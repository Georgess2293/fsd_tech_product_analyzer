1,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Mrbrightside860,12545,2023-10-02 09:56:15,Optical fingerprint scanner confirmed in reply’s
2,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Merman123,12545,2023-10-02 09:28:07,The flatter display looks great.
3,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,karthikeyanv,12545,2023-10-02 09:13:11,"Still not clear whether it has GN1/GN2 as well the type of fingerprint sensor

Edit: It looks like GN1 and Optical fingerprint sensor. Too bad for a flagship from Google.."
4,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,scharlieb931,12545,2023-10-02 10:55:03,"Personally, I don’t think the GN1 sensor is a huge issue. I own both Pixel 7 and the new iPhone 15 Pro, and I still prefer the shots taken by the Pixel over iPhone’s 24 MP shots.

The FP sensor is another story. At the point I can only hope that Google has done some optimisation for the FP on Pixel 8 series.

I’ll still get the Pixel 8 Pro as I just love Pixel’s software, I literally can’t daily drive any other OS after using Pixel. But yeah I can understand why people are disappointed by the hardware"
5,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Starks,12545,2023-10-02 14:03:51,The uploader says the modem is 5300i.
6,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Gseventeen,12545,2023-10-02 11:39:05,That black is outstanding.
7,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,i4mt3hwin,12545,2023-10-02 10:12:14,"I guess the free watch promotion will make it worth it but if we ignore that, spending flagship prices for generations old technology doesn't seem like a great deal to me.

The camera sensors are almost all outdated, except for the ultra wide. The front camera is same as 7/6 which is an abomination (let's be real autofocus isn't fixing this). It uses the same modem from the 7, which while better than the 6, is miles behind Qualcomm. Tensor while catching up to last year's phones (if it even does that) is going to be a generation behind when the s24 comes out. UFS 3.1 instead of 4, etc. 

What exactly are you getting for your money here? I guess googles software but Samsung has duplicated the call answering features and there's also software functionality Samsung has that Google doesn't - so in the software front even that is a tossup. (I definitely prefer googles voice processing)

Idk im just kind of disappointed. Will wait to launch/reviews to see if they worked some kind of magic but I think this might be the first google device I skip and I've been buying nexus/pixels since the galaxy nexus. I just don't see the value."
8,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Mrbrightside860,12545,2023-10-02 09:58:16,So an GN1 with optical fingerprint scanner ;) what a shame
9,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,cdegallo,12545,2023-10-02 13:03:41,"So many people in these threads talking about the GN1 camera sensor being older and not updated.  Google went from a much older main sensor--the IMX363 was released in 2016--to the GN1 which was released in 2020--and despite all of the technical gains, the main actual difference has been better dynamic range in videos.  Images aren't significantly different or improved despite the technical improvements like noise, dynamic range, and resolution properties of the sensor.  And given google's heavy HDR+ processing, it's unknown whether the hardware capabilities of the sensor would translate to practical differences.  Maybe the would and maybe they wouldn't, I don't know, but I'm not convinced that it would make such a huge difference.

So while I think there's a big disparity in the rumored price increases for largely a similar hardware experience for the phone, I'm not so convinced that google's photo experience will be practically improved if they went with the GN2.

And anyway, google has shown us that they tend to stick with sensors for quite some time--3 years in the case of the pixel 3, 4, and 5 model years using the same primary sensor.  So moving the 8 to something newer would have been surprising."

11,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,mr-jeeves,12545,2023-10-02 12:46:01,"Really scratching my head on this one. I love my Pixel 5 and it's exactly the size I want. So the Pixel 8 would be ideal, but the Pro looks tasty! Not too gleaming and shiny and slippery and impractical, though quite big comparatively."
12,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,ibrowseee,12545,2023-10-02 12:56:20,"I think I may pick up a cheap pixel 7 now. Then wait for another pixel in 2 - 3 years. 

Is this the play?  Current phone is Pixel 5."
13,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Revolutionary_Path83,12545,2023-10-02 14:27:27,So many people making final decisions about a product that still hasn't been officially shown to us yet.
14,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Pistaciyo,12545,2023-10-02 14:22:35,"Gosh, the matte black is drop-dead gorgeous. Definitely the prettiest Google-made phone to date."
15,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Responsible_Image_58,12545,2023-10-02 14:43:38,That black is sick as hell. I probably will be ordering that one
16,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,bob_squared2020,12545,2023-10-02 14:36:04,"So the same optical fingerprint scanner, same GN1 sensor, same battery capacity, etc., so if you got the P7P you shouldn't upgrade. The only difference is a few new exclusive AI features and a flat screen. Tensor G3 may or may not provide better heat management and longer battery life. If the G3 does those things it'll only be very incremental at best and isn't worth the upgrade. The only downside is the P7P trade in value will plummet after this year."
17,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,zjb29877,12545,2023-10-02 14:19:06,"This is going to be an unpopular opinion here, but I actually don't mind the camera sensor not changing and the FP sensor not changing... The camera on my P7P has never failed me, aside from video not being the greatest, hopefully there's some optimization there. The FP sensor has worked flawlessly for me since day 1, but I know that isn't the case for everyone. 

My biggest issues are heating, efficiency and battery life. If all 3 have improved, this will be an instant trade in for me. Based on benchmarks, performance should match the SD 8+G1, let's hope the efficiency gains from 4nm help here. Here's to hoping."
18,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Cjo1992,12545,2023-10-02 14:10:15,I was convincing myself that I was going to get the 8 Pro even though my 7 Pro is fine besides bad battery life. But these leaks are helping me change my mind. I guess I'll see how much the trade in value is plus the free watch might still make it worth it.
19,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,alphaPhazon,12545,2023-10-02 15:37:14,"Knowing that the hardware is pretty much the same as last gen, it actually makes me excited about what comes next for my P7 ...
I mean if what we saw about low light video is true then Google did some software magic that will probably benefit 7 series as well."
20,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,barefootBam,12545,2023-10-02 16:43:47,so does anyone know when these will start shipping out after pre-order? would be nice to get these before Halloween.
21,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,kaysquare0007,12545,2023-10-02 17:11:01,Beautiful
22,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Zenzui0000,12545,2023-10-02 18:38:51,Screen is very flat. Loving it! Going to upgrade my P6Pro to 8Pro for this.
23,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Mrbrightside860,12545,2023-10-02 09:57:35,Sensor and aperture seems to be the same as Pixel 8….
24,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,loathsomeleukocytes,12545,2023-10-02 11:52:16,They should at least upgrade the main sensor. I won't buy Pixel this year. I will go for Galaxy S24u.
25,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Beneficial_Raise5191,12545,2023-10-02 14:48:24,"No jade color options, no GN2, same modem...
It makes me consider to switch other band or skip 2-3 generation"
26,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,iWorkSlow,12545,2023-10-02 14:12:41,It kind of looks like an iPhone 11 Pro Max (in a good way). That was the last iPhone that actually felt good in the hand. One thing I love about my 7P is that it feels pretty rounded with the official Pixel case.
27,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Zombiechrist265,12545,2023-10-02 11:56:44,"With these specs and no ultra sonic fingerprint then they better not up the price in Europe or else it’s over.

Also please no overheating. If it does then I’m going full Samsung. At least they are stable and got everything best in the business."

34,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Aditya1801,12545,2023-10-14 05:22:59,"I thought quite different for Pixel 8 Pro, but quite disappointe with its performance later on with the integrated Tensor chip . There are some sort of overheating issues that are quite intense during heavy multitasking and games. Processing is quite slow and user cannot expect good result. Despite being a decent camera setup, the performance totally lacks down with battery issues as well."
35,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,BMox81,12545,2023-10-02 11:32:34,"At last! A comment not about fingerprint and GN1 sensors!

38,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Easystanza,12545,2023-10-02 12:51:23,I don't understand why people have such an issue with the pixel fingerprint scanner. My P7P one works great and I never even have to think about it anymore
39,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,actionguy87,12545,2023-10-02 14:13:29,"The wide spectrum of varying experiences with this scanner is crazy. I have the 7 Pro and I love the scanner, I literally never have problems and it works incredibly fast. Much better than fumbling for the scanner on the back of the Pixel 5 and more reliable than face unlock."

42,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,LiterallyZeroSkill,12545,2023-10-02 09:58:47,"Both 8 and 8 Pro are optical - per the uploader.

If the pricing rumours are true this is truly a terrible buy for most people..."

Pixels have never boasted the latest and greatest camera hardware, and have always had amazing processing."
47,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,atomofconsumption,12545,2023-10-02 13:08:30,"Same, I got the iPhone 15 pro and love the hardware. But the os is so dated compared with my pixel 5. So I’m just going to return this and get the pixel 8."
48,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,LadFromWales,12545,2023-10-02 14:04:19,"Sony Xperia is another option if you like the Pixel style experience.

Very ""stock"" experience with Google dialer and business lookup etc. No hold for me etc though.

I've got the Xperia 1 IV at the moment but am considering getting the 8 Pro. Not sure, new sensor would have been nice, but as has been said it's unlikely to make a massive difference.

At the end of the day these are still tiny sensors with output which looks awful until it is processed and we see the final output."

Edit: due to my bad math, the effective price of the Pixel 8 Pro is actually $550"

54,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,TubbyFlounder,12545,2023-10-02 13:39:24,didnt it leak the p8 is $100 more than the 7 also? (pro is still the same)
55,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,hectorlf,12545,2023-10-02 13:59:12,"I think that you're overreacting.

Camera sensors aren't outdated. GN1 is 2-3 years old max, and the only other Samsung 50mpx sensor of comparable specs is GN2. GM5, the tele sensor, is even newer. The front facing camera is *not* the same (if leaks are right), the mpx count is different.

Modem might be the same or a newer revision, but yeah, not the best, ok on that. And tensor might be catching up, right.

Pixel is still cheaper than the comparable devices from Samsung or Apple, and you still have other parts of the phone that have improved. You get the value you pay for.

It's ok to be disappointed, but that's on you. Other people might find the value they get is worth the money."
56,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Gseventeen,12545,2023-10-02 11:40:18,"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Faster chip or not, samsung phones run like garbage."

58,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,p7rk,12545,2023-10-02 13:29:56,"True, after all old, known sensor but wider aperture is not that bad. The Chinese brands have those huge 1-inch sensors, and they have great peak-performance, especially in night shots. But at the same time they are very inconsistent like missed exposure, wrong WB, under or over saturation, motion blur etc. The HDR isn't always better."
59,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,BathtubGiraffe5,12545,2023-10-02 17:37:36,"Aye the sensor size difference in this case isn't anything super special. If anything the software processing adjusting to the newer sensor is still not too great IMO. I'm normally 50/50 on whether I like the pixel 6 pro photos. Often over sharpened and cartoonish, seems to really struggle with taking photos of people's faces I've found as it always just prioritises the HDR instead."
60,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,delta7019,12545,2023-10-02 14:36:24,Do what you want. I went from 2 to 7--and only because the $350 deal was too good to pass up. A new phone really has to wow me to justify upgrading before my current device fails me.
61,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,starfishtwo,12545,2023-10-02 18:22:49,"My counter to this would be the extended software support and the watch deal/earbuds deal for the respective models.  Jumping from a 5 to an 8 is still pretty good, and then you can hold on to the 8 for even longer till they iron out stuff instead of being on a three year clock.  At least that’s what I’m doing.  I have a 7p and was planning to hold on to it, but software, the watch, and honestly the flat screen convinced me.  So then, I can just sit on it."

The processing always has been, even with inferior hardware the software gave it a fighting chance against it's competitors since the original pixel and we WERE happy to come along for the ride with a camera that is just a step behind the competition at a fraction of the price, and its STILL not good enough for some of you."
87,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,willyolio,12545,2023-10-02 13:27:07,"because it's the last thing to confirm and there's basically nothing else worth looking forward to, or to justify an upgrade or purchase.

G2 -> G3 is going to be a standard incremental upgrade.  Still Exynos, still Samsung, still probably going to have all the efficiency issues.  Battery life and performance is still going to be below average.  Screen is nothing to write home about, just keeping up with the market.  RAM and memory are actually below average at this point.  Oh, and large price increases.

GN2 is basically the last thing that might justify all of this.  People buy pixels for the cameras.  The camera performance for the money is basically the only thing keeping the pixel lineup afloat.  So why wouldn't people want the next generation to have one of the *best* cameras on the market to pair with the software? Otherwise you're basically going to pay $700 for a software update.

At this point, simply buying a pixel 7 on discount will be a much better deal than a pixel 8.  The pixel 8 is having a hard time justifying its own existence."
88,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,Mintykanesh,12545,2023-10-02 15:10:56,Well because a lot of people here already have pixel phones so the new sensor would have represented an improvement for them and a reason to upgrade.

The problem is that offer isn't available in every market and I already have both a Samsung GW5 and a Garmin Watch. I don't really want a Pixel Watch - but I do really want a good Pixel Phone. Even if I sold the watch the phone isn't really an upgrade over my S23U (again barring any launch/review magic). It would just be paying $650 for a sidegrade.

But as someone that did find value in previous ones I'm finding it harder and harder to justify - especially as other companies catch up in areas where Google was once king.

That being said I disagree about what you wrote about the cameras.

The GN1 and the GM5 are both 3 years old. I think the GM5 was announced like 2 months after the GN1. They are both old. The GN1 was replaced with the GN2.. its just a better sensor overall and not ""comparable"" - its a direct upgrade. Regardless, there's still the HP2 - which is a newer generation although arguably makes trades vs being a direct upgrade.  But even if you say that's the same.. you have the Sony IMX 989, which is shipping in phones this year and is unarguably a significant upgrade over all three sensors.

The front facing camera according to the same leaks is a ISOCELL 3J1 which is the same in both the 6/7 - Samsung lists it as a 11mp camera, some sites have it has 10.8, it's spec sheet has it as 10.87 - other companies list it as 10.5. Its possible that it's upgraded but according to the leaks that's the sensor model."
103,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,itaintrite,12545,2023-10-02 16:03:58,"Nah, the Pixel 8 Pro will be an objectively disappointing product if these leaks are to be believed. And this is coming from a long-time Pixel user.

3.5-year-old main camera sensor, AI software not even that great (terrible edge detection in portrait mode and cinematic mode, albeit might have been improved, we'll see)

My money's on battery performance still meh even with an underwhelming processor.

""But they always get the fastest and quickest updates because Pixel"" lol sure

And the worst part? It's not even cheaper. A 256GB S23+ is $899 making it at least the same price. And if you want to compare to the flagship, the 256GB Ultra is $1099 vs a 256GB 8 Pro which will either be $999/1099.

Will I upgrade tho? Yes, but only because the QC on the Pixel 7 Pro is crap and I'm already on my 4th replacement. Not waiting for the warranty to run out for sure. The only redeeming quality of the Pixel will be the pre-order freebie and vanilla Android. But if Samsung were to offer a great trade in value for my Pixel 7 Pro, I'd switch in a heartbeat."

Given the crazy sales pre or post launch Pixel Pro is less than half the price as say an iPhone Pro Max so naturally the quality reflects that"

Either way I don't get your point.

188,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,friedAmobo,12545,2023-10-02 14:11:53,">15 Pro Max literally wins the battery test against Pixel and Samsung S23U

To be fair, everything at roughly the same size wins in a battery test against the Pixel. In TechDroider's test, the gap between the P7P (8:13) and the next worst battery life, the OP11 (9:48), was twice as large as the gap between the OP11 and the winner 15 Pro Max (10:31). 

The Samsung-fabbed Tensor chips are noticeably cutting into the Pixel's efficiency, because the rest of its spec sheet suggests that it shouldn't be that far behind the competition in battery life. The chipset is the only major difference between the P7P and the rest of its Android competition, which are all running on the TSMC-fabbed 8G2."
189,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,p7rk,12545,2023-10-02 14:58:15,"That's obvious for me that 15PM will be better than P6P if it would be other way, then this would be really crazy. I referred to the non-Max 15 Pro, which could on Par with P7P, or only slightly better which is not an argument for change.   
The Max iPhones, whit their bulky, wide build and terrible (or even missing in some views) back gesture makes it impossible to use one-handed, while I use my P7P without any issue with only one hand, and it's middle-sized.  
Battery and power efficiency would be my main argument to switch from Pixel to iPhone, but this year it's not a strong one."
190,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,MastodonSmooth1367,12545,2023-10-02 17:57:51,"I don't get why so many people like to justify Google's usage of older components. The entire competition uses either the newest stuff or sometimes 1 slightly older generation. Even when it comes to Apple there was plenty of outrage amongst Apple fans about the 15 Pro sensor size being the same. If that's not a good thing for them, then why should we justify that here?

The GN1 is an old sensor, and the GN2 is old too--being introduced in 2021 with the Mi 11 Ultra. We should use newer hardware when possible. I would hope that if we can't use a newer sensor, that at least we improve the edge sharpness issues on the Pixel 7 Pro."

In Phonebuff's 14PM versus P7P test, the 14PM won out with a 21% higher screen-on time. That's not all that far off from the difference in the TechDroider test (+28% battery life). Like with ZONEofTECH and Phonebuff, the TechDroider test showed the 14PM and S23U neck-and-neck, but all three did show the 14PM slightly edging out the S23U which suggests that it had marginally better battery life."

208,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,ZerotheWanderer,12545,2023-10-02 16:35:55,"Truthfully, I don't know.

When I was looking for a screen protector, I heard good things about that company. When you have a curved screen, protectors are a lot harder to come by, so I expect them to be less available and more expensive.

Installation is a bit of a pain, and I don't know how bad it would be to remove it because of the glue/ adhesive you have to apply the screen protector with.

After about a year of use, there's a handful of small scratches on it from being in my pocket with my keys but that's it.

At the time of ordering, Spigen did not have a screen protector and some of the cheap ones on Amazon did not look like they fit as good as you would hope so I didn't even bother wasting my time or money on those, I just wanted a good protector from the get-go.

As far as price goes, I'm not going to complain about paying twice the price that I normally would, because it's going on a $900 object that I use daily, skimping out regardless of what it is if you want to protect it makes no sense to me.

That's like complaining about the price of oil for your car, 30 bucks every 5000 miles is a lot cheaper than a whole new engine. Breaking and replacing a screen protector is a lot cheaper than the screen itself, and a lot easier."

212,Google Pixel 8 Pro Unboxing ASMR #shorts,ZerotheWanderer,12545,2023-10-02 21:15:17,"From what I gather, I would assume removing it is similar to removing a normal cracked screen protector, chip it off in pieces. Once it has cured, it should act like any other normal screen protector adhesive. I'm sure you can find videos on it, I never considered looking it up because I didn't really have a need to remove it, but if I was in a pinch I would just attempt to do it the same as previous ones.

The whole oil and engine thing is essentially saying that the protection is cheap, the item as a whole is expensive. I would much rather pay $15 for a screen protector as opposed to hundreds for the replacement. An oil change is 30 bucks, a whole engine is thousands of dollars."

Since I couldn't connect it the to internet, I couldn't easily download the previous update to see if I could fix it. (I think that was the problem) 

I probably could have fixed it maybe if I tried to download that update on a laptop and upload it that way. But by that point it was getting too troublesome."

At the same time, my mom's Huawei p20 Lite, which she bought at around the same time, and which costed the exactly the same as well, has gone to shit after a year – it began constantly freezing, and generally became pretty slow and laggy.

The thing with Android is the same as with Windows – it's a system that can run on tens of thousands of different models of devices, which means some of these devices can be shit (like low-tier Huawei phones), some can be relatively decent most of the time (like low tier Samsung), and some run great for years (like Pixels, which run on pure Android and are a perfect fit for it due to both being developed by Google, as well as most flagship phones by prominent phone corporations)."

All my cellphones had stock Android, and I was fine. I hated to see anything that didn't have the stock UI.

Then I bought a S22 Ultra (I wanted their cameras). Well, they do have some little inconveniences in the Settings (out of place, imo), but I have to say that I really like their UI. I deactivated all apps I don't need (took me less than 3 minutes of my life), and I don't see me coming back to stock again."

I hate it. And the video quality is just rotten compared to my iphone. But the standalone photo quality shits on apple. And the customization and the Android U thing is super cool.

373,6 Months Google Pixel 7 pro,ChuckSkywalker,11903,2023-04-09 02:22:32,"I go back and forth for the last 3 years (prior was only Windows & Androids).  What i found was that MACBOOK PROs are the best laptop, i even have Windows 10 installed using bootcamp and its way faster than being on a windows laptop.  I found everything just works and plays together nicely, and the Apple Watch is by far the best functioning device Ive ever used, even samsung watches have there issues (speaker phone sucks).

Nor the other side of the coin is, When everything works fine and you have no ability customize much (apple gets a little boring),  Cant never complain about battery power, all my IOS/MacOS devices the batteries last way longer then I ever need to use them. 

Siri does fine, but never will be as smart as Google.  Apple Maps does good, but never will be better than Google Maps. 

Bottom line, it will be hard for anyone to give you 100% positive info for one side only.  Every-time im about to switch back to Android, i realize all that I will be giving up.  Still sometimes I do switch back but within 1 year (at most), im trading in for a Apple Phone again.

Cameras are the best, to many companies making Androids there way, and modifying the code.  Most reason for the issues.  Apple just works because none of that is happening.

If the 8 at least fixes the selfie camera problem, ill definitely upgrade. Other than that, the phone has a really nice charm to it that I've lost with an iPhone. However, the design of the 5 is much more attractive to me and way smaller which would be better for one-handed use. If it had much longer OS and security support, I would've upgraded to that instead of the 7. Not complaining though. 

Also, the speakers are really tinny compared to the iPhone 12, but I've gotten used to it."

The pixel 7 pro is slick, smart and android to me is just as polished as iOS. Apple have fallen hard. I regret all the apple purchases I made like ten home pod minis which are temperamental, whereas my Google speakers and the assistant work every time."
383,6 Months Google Pixel 7 pro,pdxcomputerpro,11903,2023-04-09 21:03:29,"I’ve was a HUGE Android fanboy and was sooo excited for the Pixel 6 launch…. Then it came out and it was HUGE. So I bit the bullet and switched to the iPhone 13 Mini from the Pixel 5 (I’d tried 2 previous iPhones over the years and returned them, went back to Android) - mostly wanted a small pocketable device with a great camera. 

Over a year later, there are a couple things I miss from the Pixel line but I imagine I’ll stick with iOS at this point. I LOVE the Cinematic video mode for videos of my kids. I miss not having messages in my web browser on any computer. The new iOS lock screens with portraits partially behind the clock widget are SLICK.

I don’t miss weekly stories about this and that Android breach or security flaw and 20 malicious apps being found and removed from the play store. 

iMessage and FaceTime are a huge pro as much as I hate to admit it. And I love the physical Silent Slider. Had this on a OnePlus phone and it was slick. 

I DO have and prefer my Android Tablet to the iPad, especially with the Kiwi Browser that can run desktop class chrome extensions.

At the end of the day, I think Android continues to be a great ecosystem for those of us that love to tinker with our phones and be creative while the iPhone is a utility for people that want a solid reliable experience to simply get things done."

I was able to get a $450 trade-in value through Google with the pre-order and I found that it was a really good deal, so I went with it. And I have no regrets. I really wasn't in the Apple ecosystem ( only had AirPods which I gave to my brother ), so it wasn't a huge change for me. I don't have any regrets. I didn't use FaceTime a whole bunch and I personally find Google Messages a bit better, so I don't see myself returning back to Apple anytime soon"

I am still getting my head wrapped around everything, but what I can say is that it is a damn relief to no longer use Carplay. I had so many issues with Siri that it ended up being the catalyst for switching. Carplay and homekit was literally a nightmare for me to use, since I relied on Siri. Switching to Google and everything just works. 

I can also say that typing on the pixel 6A is way more easier for me as well. I like the overall feel of the phone. I will be keeping my iPhone for work and whatnot, so I have not completely left apples sphere. But it's a step away from it."

I like these things, but I must say I regret the swap. 
The keyboard swipe sucks, voice to text is AWFUL, and the OS is glitchier than Android… it’s as bad or worse than some ancient Nexus phones.

The only thing I wish they kept was the fingerprint reader in the back that I could also use to pull down the notification shade. That was one of my absolute favorite features on my original Pixel XL.

I was shocked how far down the majority of people found their picture outcomes.

It is this metric to judge phones by I thought I'd never see drop. So now I see Apple truly cutting costs as much as they fully can while exuding wealth.

That's the Apple difference. Since only they make the hardware, they don't make a low end model. See this often. Someone upgrades from a $500 HP laptop to a $1,800 MBP and is all ""Windows sucks!"" Or a $300 Samsung J series to a 14 Pro ""Android is so bad!"""

If you want you can install kde connect for all kind of integration. 

I bought it 10 years ago when Mac was least bloated but they kept adding bloat and made it harder to remove. Right now it's almost impossible to remove an app that I don't use.

I might not buy a MacBook again but trying to dip my toes into the Chromebook world. They are the real ecosystem of android. With the android app and Linux application now on Chromebook they have become a real laptop replacement. 

With phone hub you can sync notification, tether, see network and battery status, nearby share between android and Chromebook devices.

Now Google just released a phone app streaming to Chromebook so you can make and receive calls on Chromebook, use any app on phone on your Chromebook."

Controversial one, camera. I work in a phone shop where most of my colleagues have iPhones (literally everyone but my manager and me) they have iPhone 14 pros and pro maxes. Every time we've tested our cameras against eachother my pixel has had consistently more visible zoom, clearer results, more detail, shadows, the 6 used to overprocess the shots a little too much but I've had none of that on my p7p.
Also, I cannot explain the freedom provided by a back button. Making app developers not have to put their own back buttons into their apps leads to a kinda inconsistent and personally claustrophobic feel. And the pixels are exciting tbh, new features are actually new and exciting features most times. 
It's mostly personal preference."

This is the first Google phone for me since nexus 6p and I'm glad to be back. The camera software and hardware is just next level."
522,My Google Pixel 7 Pro Outshines my iPhone,timsadiq13,11903,2023-01-15 20:27:02,"Meh, having owned the Pixel 7 Pro I have to disagree. Yes, it has some cool features that are not present on iPhones, but there are just too many bugs to make it a worthwhile device at least for me. Ofc everyone has a unique experience and bugs I experienced may not be a problem for others.

For instance, Gmail notifications are dogshit on Android. They are so delayed I always have to use Outlook, but that has an ad ever present unless you pay for one of their subscriptions. In contrast, iOS Gmail is flawless.

A simple thing, but if I was using WiFi for a while and I turned it off before leaving the house, or just left and it lost the connection to my home WiFi, data would just not work until I cycle Airplane mode on and off quickly. Then it worked fine, but still, what a dumb bug. I did find that you could leave Mobile Data always on to solve the issue, but that did seem to drain the battery a bit more.

Horizontal scrolling was dogshit on the 7 Pro. Going through the recent apps was torture, the same gesture could take me past four apps, to the next one, or stay stuck in the same place, whatever he phone felt like doing it seemed.

I didn't have any vertical scrolling issues but you can search this sub to learn more about that if you want. 

Also the display brightness was annoying. The auto brightness was far far too dim, even compared to my OnePlus 8T that I owned before the 7 Pro. Only solution was to turn off auto brightness. I tried for weeks for it to ""learn"" my preferences with the auto brightness but it was still too dim.

Then we come to the face unlock / fingerprint reader nonsense. Enabling both it always felt like they were fighting each other to see what would unlock my phone first. With both enabled or just the fingerprint, still so many times it was asking me for my pin. On iOS it happens just once a day where it says I need the pin to unlock the phone and Face ID. The fingerprint reader was also unreliable. Worked 90% of the time on my left thumb, maybe 20% of the time on the right thumb. The whole thing got so annoying I just set up the smart unlock with a fitbit watch. At least that was reliable lol.

I also didn't like the speakers on the 7 Pro, they were not impressive especially for such a big phone.

Battery life was also just okay. My OP 8T was better for SOT compared to 7 Pro. Charging was slow (thats true on iPhones as well tbf).

And in general what everyone else says about apps just working better on iOS, I have to agree with that."
523,My Google Pixel 7 Pro Outshines my iPhone,Simon_787,11903,2023-01-15 07:42:06,"It's an awesome phone.

But... like... advancements in technology and design since the Pixel 6? It's just a more refined version that fixed stuff that shouldn't have been problems in the first place, like the poor efficiency of the Tensor and the modem.

It's a decent phone though, I just kinda miss old Pixels with their fingerprint scanners and lighter chassis."

Phones are just a commodity now, like computers."
526,My Google Pixel 7 Pro Outshines my iPhone,Mattycakes_Walsh_III,11903,2023-01-15 16:39:42,"I've owned every pixel except the 5 since the 2 and I now have the regular 6. I got it for $250 used in November and I love it. I had an iPhone 12 at launch and I got so sick of ios restrictions so I sold it and went back to the 4. I'll get the 7 next year probably, unless the 8 is completely earth shattering"
527,My Google Pixel 7 Pro Outshines my iPhone,Nickell8666,11903,2023-01-15 17:08:11,I’ve switched back and forth between the pixel and iPhone for quite a few years now. I’m now going from the iPhone 13 Pro Max to the Pixel 7. There’s nothing on the iPhone 14 Pro that makes me want it. The only thing I ever miss about iOS is iMessage. I don’t play games or use social media much.
528,My Google Pixel 7 Pro Outshines my iPhone,,11903,2023-01-15 22:06:49,I finally feel like pixel did right with this one. I have used Samsungs for 10 years and I cannot believe how smooth my pixel 7 is compared to my s22 ultra. The camera is faster and the pixel 7 userface is really as step above the s22 ultra. The battery life is outstanding as well. They truly got this one right

530,My Google Pixel 7 Pro Outshines my iPhone,DavoinShowerHandel,11903,2023-01-15 23:58:24,"Interesting. My experience with the pixels and Nexus phones is that they've gotten less refined as time has gone on. Assistant on my phone and home hubs are hit and miss, Android auto rarely reads out my messages and routinely glitches out on my P7, don't get me started on the battery life discrepancy. I think iOS has made strides in the right direction and the gap between customization is closing. Google is locking people out of basic customization while iOS is allowing more."

I decided to keep my 13 pro max for another year. It’s smooth as butter and extremely reliable. 

If I turn a blind eye to all the stutters and hiccups, I did enjoy my time with it. I was completely ready to come back to android after 3 years on iPhone. 

If google can finally knock it out the park next year ( they probably won’t ) and stop cutting corners with dollar store fingerprint reader and modems, I’ll come back to pixel. I much prefer Android but IOS is just so much smoother and polished."

While the Android ones are not slow by any means, they somehow just arrive quicker on iOS. 

For example: when I use my card at a cash register, iOS will have a bank notification pop up even before the cash register starts printing my receipt. 

My Android phones however don’t notify me until I’m half way done packing my groceries.  About 10-30 seconds a later usually.

This is clearly an indicator that it actually just ""doesn't work"", it's bad UI / features decisions, minor clunky upgrade that turned my perfectly it-just-work phone in a messy one over a few years.

I really loved iphone during the iOS 10 -> 12 era, after that I started to look for other options as I've became more and more frustrated about how apple handle their system.

What some of us might call boring about iOS a lot of people, like my wife and mother, would call stability. It already does everything they care about.

I switched to iOS last December (13 months ago, not 1 month ago) and don't really miss much except the spam filters, the native Project Fi integration, and the ability to install Firefox extensions.

What I don't miss is the constant battery anxiety that some random app might have just stolen 85% battery in the last 2 hours. Some days I'll go into the office with no cell signal, stream music on Wi-Fi for 7 hours, and come home with 65% battery left. Towards the ""end"" of my Pixel 3's life (only 2 years after purchase) I would leave it on my desk at home all day with maybe 15 minutes SoT and I would end the day with 20% battery. I just got fed up with everyone saying ""well you just need to factory reset and it'll be perfect again!"", every 3 months. 

IMO most phones are pretty much the same now, just which walled garden you want to picnic in. Probably an unpopular opinion but I don't think any phone has made significant non-incremental changes in the last ~5 years.

Duolingo has better visuals and very satisfying haptics, also better functionality. Looks like they tend to release newer features on iOS first.

YouTube autorotation to full screen in landscape is working 100% on iOS but worked 50% for me on Android. 

Overall, I like how iOS handles full screen videos using system video player, which works every time. Android just doesn’t have native video player and every developer have to make their own or use buggy 3rd party solutions (talking as Android developer myself).

Telegram messenger just works better, message emotions are downloaded immediately, but have tangible lag on Android.

Gesture thumb on the bottom of the screen has transparent background on iOS and the thumb itself adjust its color for the color of the background and it looks pretty slick. Android has a non-transparent background at the bottom and a lot of developers just don’t bother to adjust its color which result in inconsistent app look.

Animations on iOS are very consistent, as much as UI, I really like that my apps mostly look and feel very familiar.

Scroll is just better, I couldn’t get used to rapidly decaying scroll behaviour on my Pixel 7 for 2 months. Samsung implementation is better.

Also something which I cannot explain, but Android apps and UI interactions often feels like they don’t have any weight. At the same time I feel some weight and like physically interact with apps on iOS. Probably, that’s animations.

Don’t get me wrong, Android has MANY cool things, and Pixel 7 is a beast. But as UI developer I notice inconsistencies all the time and just prefer more UI polish and consistency over functionality. That may not be the case for everyone, I gave my Pixel 7 to my brother and he’s more than happy!"

No, no it's really not the solution to that problem.  It does work, but you really need to realize that 90% of users never change a single setting on their device.  Hell, that's what makes iMessage so successful, it's already installed and is the default app.

There's 0% chance that anything that requires installing an off app-store app is the solution for any kind of problem.  Google needs to build in the functionality or get the major app makers to build it in. Those are the only viable choices. 

I get that as a techy person part of what makes a phone like the Pixel good is the ability to make it do exactly what you want how you want it, no compromises.  But most people just want something that functions out of the box, they don't have the time or desire to hunt down some weird replacement app that makes their phone equal to what the competitor does out of the box. 

Note, I don't dispute that this app may work (I'm sure it does) but ""normal"" people are not going to consider a phone that won't take a good Instagram photo in the official Instagram app, period."

Use what you like or what you are used to,

If you have used Samsung all your life like me, the Samsung interface is what you are used to, all other interfaces looks weird. You also get used to the look of the apps if you have used a particular platform all your life. Like I am used to Samsung internet, Samsung email, Samsung Calender etc..  That doesn't make these apps better than the alternatives. I am just used to the look and feel of the apps. The same can be said for a pixel or iphone user.

Also, from talking to my ios developer, a lot of those things seem harder on ios. Like putting subtitles on PiP mode seemed really hard for him whereas I didn't have to do anything on Android for that.

719,My Google Pixel 7 Pro Outshines my iPhone,Expensive_Finger_973,11903,2023-01-15 22:41:29,"Would I pay $1200? I dunno, maybe, in the right situation. Thankfully though you can get a new iPhone from Apple for several hundred less than that so I doubt I would pay that much anytime soon for talk, text, photos, and basic web browsing. But one example of why I might would consider it:

Apple's screen time functionality is orders of magnitude better than Googles Family Link functionality for the use case of parental controls. Mainly around the control it gives you over the OS of the subordinate devices remotely. And since Apple sells basic tablets that mop the floor with virtually any Android tablet for the price, if you are looking for something for a kid then screen time becomes an important feature to consider that Google can not currently match.

The call screening feature you mention that is life changing for you is frustrating to more than one person I have seen experience it. Paradoxically they feel that the phone is making choices for them, or getting in the way of their interaction and they don't like it, even when it is explained that is not the case. I don't agree with them, but that is their opinion based on their initial impression. Point being just because it changes your day to day life in a good way does not mean everyone views it that way.

Additionally the Pixel will not be a flagship killer and/or over taker until it and its exclusive features are available on a scale as wide as the iPhone or a Samsung phone around the world. The Pixel has very much been a niche product for limited markets since it was called Nexus. Don't hold your breath on that changing anytime soon.

As to why would someone buy an iPhone when the 7 Pro has so many more features, if it is even available for sale in their market? You are discounting or under estimating the value a lot of people find in the familiarity of slow methodical change and simpler more directed user experiences. All of that quick change in features, functionality, and appearance tends to cause confusion and overwhelm the average person if they like the older way better. Different and more is not necessarily better to people.

There are whole articles and studies out there about how past a certain point to many options becomes a negative to people and they get overwhelmed by them and have a hard time even making a choice to begin with. In my experience the same sort of thing applies to options within software. If it is to busy or nested to deep people tend to get overwhelmed."

It was a mass blind test based on how ‘pretty’ photos look from different phones. iPhone would never win that contest because it uses real, not over saturated colors and does not dial HDR way up like Pixel. Watch hundreds of other reviews on YouTube comparing these two phone cameras from actual pros and you will see that Pixel still lacks in many departments with one notable exception for the night mode."

His test was 3 photos of a very specific subject. While the iPhone didn’t do amazing in those, it does amazing in almost every other instance. Video it’s still undisputed number 1."
735,My Google Pixel 7 Pro Outshines my iPhone,netscorer1,11903,2023-01-15 13:54:26,"Well, for one Pixel can’t even take real macro photos as far as I’m aware because it lacks focus for its ultra wide camera. As for portrait mode, iPhone uses a better algorithms to produce more natural boka compared to Pixel. I take portrait shots very often (probably 15-20% of all my shots) and Pixel can’t stand even close in end. In iPhone I can change lightning and boka in preview and play around until I get the best result. In pixel I don’t even see portrait effect until couple of seconds after the shot is taken, can’t change lightning and unblur is just not up to par with iPhone. I always end up with some loose hair cut unnaturally on Pixel photos."

If you have to compare two videos side by side on large, hi-res monitors and quality speakers to pick out subtle differences in video and audio quality, there isn't an undisputed winner in video. Whereas with pictures, I think the differences between the two are very apparent even on a 6"" smartphone display. 

I'm not even convinced the iPhone has objectively better video quality than Pixel. I've noticed a large shift ever since MKBHD's blind test where a lot of ""mainstream"" reviewers and tech journalists are suddenly realizing the Pixel takes very good photos. Until that point, they just latched onto their preconceived biases that iPhone took the best photos, even if that hadn't been true for many years. I think we're one or two blind video tests away from people having a similar realization about video.

Not saying the iPhone camera is bad at all. Overall, it's a good, flexible camera system. iPhones have great processing power and battery efficiency, and no one can deny it's a polished OS with great interoperability between users and Mac hardware. But people coming in here saying the Pixel camera is shit are either trolling or severely misguided, because Pixels have been killing it in the photo department for years and are at the very least comparable in the video department."

I think price keeps going up and now have like yearly subscription plan too. But yes for sure Apollo is the top app for Reddit. But I am not a super power user so for most people imo the boost app on Android will be good enough and it is only $3 one time pay.

And sure, I'd venture to say I do know better than a lot of them considering most are glorified journalists with no formal background or qualifications in technology fields, determine the content of their reviews based on public opinion and hearsay vs facts, and change their minds like the seasons when other, more influential tech reviewers have a sudden realization.

A few years ago, one of those realizations was that CPU benchmarks didn't really matter, soon after there were articles and videos left and right about the ""problem with benchmarks"". Now it's photography as the iPhone has been decidedly dethroned by a blind camera test/people's choice award, Pixels are suddenly great cameras, and iPhone users are left clinging to microscopic at best advantages in video quality."

830,6 Months Google Pixel 7 pro,ChuckSkywalker,11908,2023-04-09 02:22:32,"I go back and forth for the last 3 years (prior was only Windows & Androids).  What i found was that MACBOOK PROs are the best laptop, i even have Windows 10 installed using bootcamp and its way faster than being on a windows laptop.  I found everything just works and plays together nicely, and the Apple Watch is by far the best functioning device Ive ever used, even samsung watches have there issues (speaker phone sucks).

Nor the other side of the coin is, When everything works fine and you have no ability customize much (apple gets a little boring),  Cant never complain about battery power, all my IOS/MacOS devices the batteries last way longer then I ever need to use them. 

Siri does fine, but never will be as smart as Google.  Apple Maps does good, but never will be better than Google Maps. 

Bottom line, it will be hard for anyone to give you 100% positive info for one side only.  Every-time im about to switch back to Android, i realize all that I will be giving up.  Still sometimes I do switch back but within 1 year (at most), im trading in for a Apple Phone again.

Cameras are the best, to many companies making Androids there way, and modifying the code.  Most reason for the issues.  Apple just works because none of that is happening.

If the 8 at least fixes the selfie camera problem, ill definitely upgrade. Other than that, the phone has a really nice charm to it that I've lost with an iPhone. However, the design of the 5 is much more attractive to me and way smaller which would be better for one-handed use. If it had much longer OS and security support, I would've upgraded to that instead of the 7. Not complaining though. 

Also, the speakers are really tinny compared to the iPhone 12, but I've gotten used to it."

The pixel 7 pro is slick, smart and android to me is just as polished as iOS. Apple have fallen hard. I regret all the apple purchases I made like ten home pod minis which are temperamental, whereas my Google speakers and the assistant work every time."
840,6 Months Google Pixel 7 pro,pdxcomputerpro,11908,2023-04-09 21:03:29,"I’ve was a HUGE Android fanboy and was sooo excited for the Pixel 6 launch…. Then it came out and it was HUGE. So I bit the bullet and switched to the iPhone 13 Mini from the Pixel 5 (I’d tried 2 previous iPhones over the years and returned them, went back to Android) - mostly wanted a small pocketable device with a great camera. 

Over a year later, there are a couple things I miss from the Pixel line but I imagine I’ll stick with iOS at this point. I LOVE the Cinematic video mode for videos of my kids. I miss not having messages in my web browser on any computer. The new iOS lock screens with portraits partially behind the clock widget are SLICK.

I don’t miss weekly stories about this and that Android breach or security flaw and 20 malicious apps being found and removed from the play store. 

iMessage and FaceTime are a huge pro as much as I hate to admit it. And I love the physical Silent Slider. Had this on a OnePlus phone and it was slick. 

I DO have and prefer my Android Tablet to the iPad, especially with the Kiwi Browser that can run desktop class chrome extensions.

At the end of the day, I think Android continues to be a great ecosystem for those of us that love to tinker with our phones and be creative while the iPhone is a utility for people that want a solid reliable experience to simply get things done."

I was able to get a $450 trade-in value through Google with the pre-order and I found that it was a really good deal, so I went with it. And I have no regrets. I really wasn't in the Apple ecosystem ( only had AirPods which I gave to my brother ), so it wasn't a huge change for me. I don't have any regrets. I didn't use FaceTime a whole bunch and I personally find Google Messages a bit better, so I don't see myself returning back to Apple anytime soon"

I am still getting my head wrapped around everything, but what I can say is that it is a damn relief to no longer use Carplay. I had so many issues with Siri that it ended up being the catalyst for switching. Carplay and homekit was literally a nightmare for me to use, since I relied on Siri. Switching to Google and everything just works. 

I can also say that typing on the pixel 6A is way more easier for me as well. I like the overall feel of the phone. I will be keeping my iPhone for work and whatnot, so I have not completely left apples sphere. But it's a step away from it."

I like these things, but I must say I regret the swap. 
The keyboard swipe sucks, voice to text is AWFUL, and the OS is glitchier than Android… it’s as bad or worse than some ancient Nexus phones.

They've surprisingly fallen down the ranks to the middle of the pack for flagship phones this last year. Check the end of year rankings, especially MKBHD's. I was shocked how far down the majority of people found their picture outcomes.

It is this metric to judge phones by I thought I'd never see drop. So now I see Apple truly cutting costs as much as they fully can while exuding wealth. It has become a Honda Accord with Audi S class cladding. I'm very disappointed where Tim ""Supply Chain"" Apple has taken the company from Jobs design and UX vision.

How much was your MacBook Pro? $1,500? $2,000? I promise you that same priced Windows laptop is every bit as fast, if not faster.   
That's the Apple difference. Since only they make the hardware, they don't make a low end model. See this often. Someone upgrades from a $500 HP laptop to a $1,800 MBP and is all ""Windows sucks!"" Or a $300 Samsung J series to a 14 Pro ""Android is so bad!"""

If you want you can install kde connect for all kind of integration. 

I bought it 10 years ago when Mac was least bloated but they kept adding bloat and made it harder to remove. Right now it's almost impossible to remove an app that I don't use.

I might not buy a MacBook again but trying to dip my toes into the Chromebook world. They are the real ecosystem of android. With the android app and Linux application now on Chromebook they have become a real laptop replacement.

The last andriod I used was a galaxy 4 before going to iphone from the 6-13pro Max. I just got bored I think, so I gave the pixel 7pro a chance. Somedays I wish I got the s22 ultra but I'm pleased with my 7 pro and expect to use it for years to come.

Controversial one, camera. I work in a phone shop where most of my colleagues have iPhones (literally everyone but my manager and me) they have iPhone 14 pros and pro maxes. Every time we've tested our cameras against eachother my pixel has had consistently more visible zoom, clearer results, more detail, shadows, the 6 used to overprocess the shots a little too much but I've had none of that on my p7p.
Also, I cannot explain the freedom provided by a back button. Making app developers not have to put their own back buttons into their apps leads to a kinda inconsistent and personally claustrophobic feel. And the pixels are exciting tbh, new features are actually new and exciting features most times. 
It's mostly personal preference."

It often doesn't recognize my fingerprint, which is a problem when apps require one. The screen stretches when I scroll. The phone freezes more than I'm used to, particularly after updates, so I have to restart it way more than with my Pixel 4a 5g. It gets hot easily. And it certainly doesn't have 30x zoom, which is what I was really looking forward to. I wondered why it was smeared at that magnification whereas a friend's Samsung was fairly sharp, and then discovered that it really only has 5x zoom, so you're better off using 5x and cropping to zoom in. Colors are off. The pink sun in the recent wildfire haze turned out white. A porch support near a streetlight at night, which should have been a dark shadow, was neon blue. 
My sense is that the touchscreen on this phone is problematic, as I've heard others complain. The various online fixes I've seen for these issues either don't work or are a bit complicated for this non-techie to follow. I just end up wasting my time. Google seems too big to care about customer service, so I have no idea whether my device is defective. Verizon isn't much better. I'm used to the Pixel system and appreciate the absence of bloatware, but I'll have to think long and hard about whether I'll get another Pixel when this one dies."

I came from a OP7P,  so essentially the same phone as you. The phone is solid, no issues with build for me. Facial recognition is fine, along with the fingerprint sensor. Not really any worse than my OP7P. And the screen immediately was noticably better than the OnePlus when I took it out of the box, with more vibrant colors and a generally more pleasant screen. I don't use a magnetic charger so I can't say anything about that. And yea, you can't expect a phone that isn't from OnePlus to have features that are only on OnePlus, like the V thing. The Either you got a defective one or you're talking out of your ass, bc this phone is perfectly fine for me. 

The one actual complaint I have is that Google assistant of all things seems to hear my voice a little bit worse, but it's nothing deal braking, every once in a while I may just have to change my timer from 14 to 40 minutes"

I see a few parallel retailers selling the 11 in Auckland now. No idea if it's the international version or Chinese though which might pay into whether I get it or wait for other retailers to pick it up. Very interested in the 11 as my new phone and it looks like the pixel is a hard pass. I couldn't bear slow charging. My 3t still fully charges in just over an hour.

The build quality is superb. Everything about it feels good.

Why do most phones have the power and volume buttons on the same side? That alone would make me stick with OnePlus."

Also the phone would take so damn long to charge and get so hot for no reason making it feel so uncomfortable in the hand. I also couldn't stand how the speakers were not balanced. The bottom speaker was firing so much louder than the top one and it would drive me nuts! The screen colors were only decent looking when the screen brightness was past 80% and why would I blind myself at night just to have a decent looking media experience. Yes the cameras were pretty great but it was not worth losing all the other things I missed about oneplus. I upgraded from my OP 7T to my new OP 11.

ESPECIALLY with the volume buttons on the opposite side of the power, I had so many accidental screenshots and missed calls from silencing the phone by mistake it wasn't even funny, and it took forever to find that I could turn those shortcuts off.

Switched to the Pixel 7 Pro and have been very happy to be back.

I do wish it had the metal back and rear fingerprint scanner from the 2 XL, and the fingerprint scanner doesn't seem to like one of my fingers (trained it twice and it still only works on that one part of the time), but it's overall been a more solid experience for me than OnePlus, which is sad because I was really hoping that would work out with everything I've heard about them."

The funniest thing is that my 6T still works and currently it's with my friend, and my other friend's 5T still works perfectly too.  OnePlus ruined their own reputation after 7 pro/7T, and I don't see any reason to support them anymore nowadays."

Firstly I'd say that most people should be knowing exactly what they're getting into. I know I'm going to be losing the incredible gestures like swipe V for torch or 3 finger swipe for screenshot but you already know that?? That's the difference between different manufacturers. The Pixel has its own features. Speech to text is close to nothing else in other phones. As a heavy user of Google services, the Pixel just delivers a better Google experience. Overall the Pixel is just INCREDIBLY smart for a phone and that's something everyone forgets when it comes to using a smartphone. By no means is it perfect and phones for the next few years even will never be perfect, but it's all about appreciating what you have and adapting to the changes. Don't get another phone/move to another manufacturer if you know you're going to be missing these features you enjoy using. Not to say I love everything about the Pixel. Charging speed is terrible compared even to my 6t but I've adapted to it. A half hour charge a day still keeps me going for my personal use in a day which is nothing to complain about. No 3 swipe for screenshot? I've set my Pixel so double tap at the back takes a screenshot. Just adapt to the changes"

But trust me when I say this, P7P's 23W charging (considering you got a compatible charger - 30W PD charger with PPS) is still an upgrade from OP6T's 20W charging at least on paper, in real life there is practically no difference. And whatever difference is there will be ignorable considering the software experience and the far better camera experience. Also, you'll only need to charge your pixel once a day as it will get you through the day and some more. So it's really worth it, you will not regret it.

Edit - wrong charging specs."

1. The thumbnail is wrong. Careless mistake but a sign of a lack of attention to detail
2. When he compares macro he uses the stock macro mode on the 13 Pro Max which uses the ultrawide but he uses the 4x zoom on the Google Pixel
3. In the video samples he doesn't film both at once which could lead to difference in conditions
4. On one shot he says he put ""3x optical zoom"" but the Pixel doesn't have that. Assuming he meant digital it still isn't possible because, iirc, the iPhone automatically switches lenses when you zoom to 3x. So this isn't comparable
5. He also doesn't appear to take the photos all at the same time so comparing is a bit tricky.
6. He compares the cinematic blur and the cinematic panning because they both have cinematic in the name and are software features? Doesn't make sense to me.

E: I'm disappointed in the battery section here. This is its entirety:

> The Google Pixel 5 set a very high bar in battery life, and it’s a shame to report that this time around, the Google Pixel 6 Pro is only just average. Android 12’s battery stats reporting only reports stats over 24 hours rather than from the last charging cycle, though I would guess that I’m getting around five hours of screen on time daily. It gets me just about through a full day of heavy usage, but I definitely need to pay attention to the battery life of my phone quite a bit in order to taper my usage if required.

~ 6 hours SoT with 15% remaining, with the heaviest usage being 40 mins of genshin impact with benching, 5 hours of youtube half in background. though it appears they charged the phone so no real stats"

1148,Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro review megathread,GhostDoggoes,11037,2021-10-25 20:54:24,"Think it's pretty obvious that a lot of good reviewers like the phone and they enjoy the features of the phone to the point where some are deciding to use it through a daily drive review as well. 

On the other hand we see a lot of dumb review gripes that don't make sense. Things that are common across many many phones in the past line up of pixel phones and even other phones in general that no one really had complaints about. Maybe some iphone users trying say a few things that aren't on the iphone so they feel better like the volume and power on the same side or the camera bump being too big for them.

From my perspective there is one thing that really sells it for me and that is my uncle who drives for medical transport for elderly and sometimes they don't speak english and their new built in auto translate is excellent. The bump won't annoy him as he's had many phones with really nice quality and this one is so far excellent. And I'm getting him and I a pair as soon as it's released.

(Forget this, it is the module itself: ) Although weird question: am I supposed to remove the protector foil from the camera bar? Or is it intended to be a permanent protector?


By the way it's much larger than my good old XZ1 Compact (the last true Android compact I think), but maybe not intimidating. Also quite heavy 😀 And, to mention a positive thing too: the torch can really be used as a 🔦 on this one - unlike the Sony, which just isn't bright enough 😀
Setting up now by copying data from old phone (double USB-C cable included is useful). The process seems pretty seamless. Just installing some apps is remaining now (""completing setup"", it takes quite long).

+1: dynamic range of the main camera is really as incredible as reviews suggest

-/+1: the screen has a green/yellowish tint compared to the IPS panel of the XZ1 Compact - but maybe it's because the XZ1 is too blue"

For video, whilst it's not as good as iPhone, it's still clearly really good. It's only lagging behind on its main sensor. That's good enough for the 5 or videos I take a month. 

Camera in every category is winning on pixel in comparisons I've seen. Not sure why reviewers haven't been using telephoto on portraits, seems like a huge oversight since the natural blue on that is almost as good as the real thing and Pixels can add more blur post seemlessly. Definitely not giving iPhone the portrait title.

Battery seems mixed. Lots of those reviews rave on its battery then others say it's underwhelming. We need numbers."

1312,Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro review megathread,DockWhore,11037,2021-10-28 13:34:52,"I'm two+ days in with my 512 Pixel 6 Pro. I've been with android since the moto droid so I've got no apple experience to compare to. I almost moved to apple this upgrade but the pro features kept me around for one more iteration. I'm a fairly standard user on a personal level but heavily ingrained in Google workspace professionally. I'd say I use my phone more than most but not in the same way as a younger user would. Less video processing and social media and more general screen on time reading, coud use, and heavy gps use.

Here are the things I notice off the bat.

This thing is huge. I knew that. Coming from a pixel2xl I figured I'd get used to it. On my third day, I've tweaked things to suit and the size is nbd. It fits in the pocket of tight jeans though the top sticks out and I'll have to be mindful when I bend down. Operation in my fairly average female hands is fine but I do notice I two-hand this much more than previously. I'll adapt, I'm sure.

It's bright. Even with adaptive screen on it's really bright. I'm outside a ton. I love being able to see everything and work comfortably from my phone in the backyard. The display is crisp and detailed.
The fingerprint scanner is fantastic. My pixel2xl wasn't perfect. This feels equal if not better.

The battery isn't mind blowing but I use gps consistently in my every day life. Yesterday I didn't plug it to charge while I drove. I browsed for an hour or two in the morning, drove for a couple hours with gps on about 50% of the time, and spent a few hours in the evening working from it and generally on the internet. Went to bed with 14%. I'm stoked on that.

Friggin video and sound is excellent. Thank you Google for the speakers being on par with my last pixel. I wasn't going to upgrade with under display speakers. Sometimes I work from my laptop (an Acer Chromebook that I covet years into having it and people ask all the time what kind of computer it is) and put Netflix on my phone int he background. This rocks for that.

I miss the back, home, and app buttons across the bottom. I assume I'll get used to the gestures but it's annoying right now. Half the reason I didn't switch to apple is because I can use my phone so quickly and feel everything is intuitive to what I'm used to. This is different enough that I'm bothered. I'm not managing notifications efficiently and I'm making mistakes and having to retry actions to produce desired outcome. Notification management is 70% of my day and not feeling efficient with that may be a deal breaker for me. Well see.

Camera is an enormous upgrade. I got the update this morning so I'll have to work with it for a bit to see how it captures things for work but even yesterday I was super impressed with the zoom ability and the devel of detail in standard photos. The eraser is neat and I bet I use it but I don't edit my photos much if at all. I'm planning to see what the night shots look like tonight and I'm really excited for that.

If my pixel2xl hadn't been giving up the ghost I would have stayed with it for another year. This is nice. I have the space and speed I need (I transferred with 138g). Once I get used to gestures, I'm sure I'll be back to my typical speed of use.

But I'm probably the kind of person who should be with apple now."
1313,Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro review megathread,chiliv06,11037,2021-10-28 18:05:15,So I rushed through buying the Pixel so fast that not until today did I realize that I purchased the Pixel 6 256GB Stormy Black instead of the Pixel 6 Pro which I intended to buy. And now with the shortages and absolute mess of trying to get any of the phones now I don't want to hassle with the delays. Although TMobile is selling the Pro 128GB they expect to ship by Nov 11. Should I just stick with the Pixel 6 or should I still try to get a Pro. I am coming from a S21 Ultra 256GB so not sure how big of a downgrade it will be.

Similar to my old XZ1 Compact. Probably it keeps charge a bit better while using it, but drains a bit more when idle (3% vs 5% through the night - tbf the Sony is incredibly efficient when idle, the older Z3 Compact was even better).

&#x200B;

Two days after receiving my Pixel 6 in the mail, it fell out of my pocket. With my previous Pixel 2 model, this happened many times. As is expected. The older model never broke, never even cracked the screen. I worked outside with it and dropped it while biking once or twice. Worked great. This is a big reason I compromised on the in-app camera quality - rather than getting an iPhone I was loyal to the Pixel. 

&#x200B;

After falling out my pocket, no cracks, music was playing (I was testing the loudness of phone speakers), I didn't think anything of it. I then try to open the phone and... nothing. The screen is totally black. It is totally non-functional after a maybe 3 foot drop. Luckily, I had the foresight to get the insurance and I got the refund. 

Now, I have been on the phone waiting for someone to pick up for hours. Trying to return this phone via the online service is convoluted and confusing. The correct order doesn't even appear. I have to wait for HOURS to get someone to talk to me. 

&#x200B;

Let me say this, I'll never be getting a Google product again. If something happens to these devices, they are not in the business of making them work again. They are made cheap and there is probably a massive incentive to prevent people from returning these phones. At least with iPhone I'll have a store. I didn't want to go back to Apple, I've had them in the past and it's not my favorite, but this is far worse. 

&#x200B;

I would NOT recommend this phone to anybody. It breaks easily and the customer service is basically non-existent if it does. Total waste of time and money and as a long time Pixel user - a massive let down."

1344,Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro review megathread,itsamamaluigi,11037,2021-10-25 20:05:33,"I think it's slightly outside the norm for Android phones. There's also a very niche reason to arrange them the other way - if you use a controller with a phone clip on it, the clip may cover up the volume buttons if they use the Pixel arrangement. But if you put the volume rocker near the edge, this isn't a problem.

That said, it's not a big deal, it doesn't affect a lot of people, and a lot of popular phone gamepads/clips are designed to not cover the volume buttons, so I don't think it's a big problem. My previous phone was a Moto G that had the volume rocker near the top of the right edge, and my current one is a Pixel 4a 5G that has it near the middle. I play games with a controller and the clip I use is designed to not cover the buttons."

He's missing the point of that feature and of course no software can actually guess what's behind a bus that's front and center in a picture. Seems like a case of user error.

Also, the 4x telephoto is miles better than the digital zoom on the 5, and on par or better than the S21 Ultra and the iPhone 13 Pro.

The Android Central video comparison pits actual Pixel 5 video against the 6 Pro and if it's a true apples to apples comparison, then the 6 Pro is a significant improvement over the 5. Admittedly, the 5 isn't great in low light, but still."

The whole 3x zoom thing he keeps repeating throughout the review; 3x is a native zoom ratio for the iPhone 13 Max, so there is no sensor cropping or digital zoom going on. The pixel *does not* have a 3x optical zoom, so he's digitally zooming into the primary sensor for a 3x effective telephoto increase. It's a ridiculous comparison that will always favor the iPhone.

Battery life is average. Most reviews says you can get at least a full day on heavy usage. Some says average usage should last 2 days on pro.

You might think it's nitpicking but you claimed the back is more efficient and ergonomic when it's clearly not..

The problem isn't the placement it the implementation and if they did it right it'd work and be quick like all other phones but they f'd it up so people complain saying they shouldn't of changed it but in reality they should've just done it right to begin with..

I dunno. I've never found a back-of-case fingerprint sensor that's near where my fingers rest on the back. I can usually keep my fingers around the lower 1/3 of the phone and still reach the top comfortably with my thumb.

I loved my OnePlus 7 Pro's in-display - hands down the best fingerprint sensor I've ever used - but had build quality issues with the rest of the phone.

back-of-case does seem to be the popular one, ergonomically, but it's not a one-size-fits-all deal, and there probably won't ever be."

1653,Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro review megathread,ThumYorky,11037,2021-10-25 16:19:25,"I think people who truly understand photography will have this same opinion. Overly HDR'd photos are simply a trend and will be looked back upon distastefully (I hope). 

It's an annoying facet of review culture. Reviewers look for objective characteristics of phone cameras to compare to. ""Phone X's shadows are much brighter and clearer than phone Y's, so it takes better photos."" This gets a lot of people going about HDR, and I think it influences how camera softwares are built. 

It reminds me a lot of how 5 years ago a bunch of phones were being advertised as having ridiculously high megapixel sensors. It was an easy thing to market about and most people assumed ""more megapixels=better"". 

This is a reason I've become increasingly frustrated with Pixel's photos. In backlit scenarios it absolutely blows out the shadows, fucks up the white balance, and there's not much you can do about it. [Here's](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dpJZZe6kdSauBmPi7) a good example of what I'm talking about. The shadows are weirdly purple and fuzzy, a common Pixel issue. Those golden moments just after sunset are magical and I always try getting photos of them, but the pixel typically tries way too hard to HDR the image which looks just awful. Additionally, there's no way to change the white balance! Sunsets typically have a bunch of magentas and oranges, but the AWB corrects for them making the whole scene look green. [Here's](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ui4nH587CqEKNZSu7) an example of that. I specifically remember this scene being vididly orange with touches of magenta. 

I'm not saying this is a Pixel specific problem, I'm just saying that these are things which I feel like are easy fixes (providing more HDR and WB controls in the native camera apps) that get ignored because HDR is the zeitgeist right now."

Personally I'm like you and prefer a more subdued/realist photo, but then again anywhere I go where I know I'm gonna be taking photos I take my proper camera/lens with me. It's just on of those preference things and the ease/flexibility I find on pixel cameras is a big selling point and I don't hate the high HDR look it's just not my favourite.

Hunting through some reviews might find some comparison where Pixel 6 is compared to X phone and that phone is somewhere compared to the S9, but if I had to guess the newer tech means higher likelihood on better colors/brightness on the pixel 6.

The big thing which instantly makes the pixel screen tenfold better though IMO is the 90hz vs 60hz. It makes the world of difference in feeling like an entirely new screen having a high refresh rate screen personally.

The resolution is indeed better on the S9 though. That part isn't ambiguous. You're kinda looking at the age-old question of refresh rate vs resolution. At the phone screen size, I personally think the resolution hits diminishing returns to the point where refresh rate is vastly more noticeable, but everyone values different things there."

Depends on what you are using for comparison.  Absolute resolution or ppi?  The S9 is higher resolution and higher pixel density.

There are other aspects to consider that, in my opinion, are more important; is there black crush that impedes the use of the phone in dark environments or with certain content (S9 series suffered from this, along with other devices)?  I haven't seen black crush on the pixel 6 reported yet, but maybe it's there.

Display refresh rate is another--honestly this is a huge game changer in terms of the general interaction experience of a device.  I thought I wouldn't care about it before using one but now that I have it would be difficult to go back."

Personally, I'm too much into stock Android after using OnePlus devices for several years. I got a S21 Ultra this spring but sold it after a week or two mainly because of two reasons: Size (and weight) and software experience. I understand everybody who loves Samsungs software experience, it's so packed with features and toggles and everything. But personally I expect devices to work more out of the box the way I want them to work and I gave up after a few days finding the right toggles. Don't get me wrong, it was a good experience, but it was more like a Samsung experience than an Android experience and after OnePlus falling apart this year Google Pixel looks like the best choice for me personally.

Size issues with the S21 Ultra were also the reason I ordered the Pixel 6 over the Pro, it's just a little bit smaller, but it's the same with gloves and a glove a few mm to large or too small just won't fit."

Then I decided to buy a Huawei P30 and I got 8h SOT when it was brand new and now after 26 months I still get 5h30 SOT...   
I wanted to go back to the Pixel's because I miss the look of Pixel selfie shoots, but apparently reviewers are getting around 5h30 SOT only and that's not much for a brand new phone even if it's used heavily.

If your main thing about upgrading is the camera and you want a really fantastic rear camera that’s weaker in other areas, get the pixel.

While true, it's pretty poor considering that the common argument for not supporting phones for longer is due to third-party hardware.

The entire comparison the pixel made every picture and video a weird yellow orange hue I found to be super gross.

It doesn’t even look like the same season, it’s somehow late fall in the pixel vs late summer/early fall on the iPhone. Fine if it looked more like the pixel but he said the iPhone was much closer to real. 

Even the selfie cam was very orange and off putting to my eye. 

The macro comparison was bad too he’s barely close to the object. Of course the pixel could compare with simple telephoto. 

The iPhone macro let’s you get MUCH closer than he did I’m not even sure he was in macro mode.

You can't get confused between volume up and power because there's a gap between them. Volume up and volume down are built into the same physical rocker, and can't get confused unless you're holding your phone upside down.

But it's way simpler to figure out the orientation of the phone in the dark with this setup too. Just face the screen towards your and rotate the phone until the buttons are on the right side."

At one point they added a Samsung login requirement to access Bixby so you had to agree to all their terms and conditions before you could access the settings to disable it.

Usually it's the super low price I'd be wary of. I'd expect and android to be a decent chunk off after even 6 months, and to keep dropping. Right now I'd expect the S21 Ultra to go for anywhere from £700 if you're lucky to £900 on Ebay."

I'm not the kind of guy to rom hop a lot (have neither the time nor the energy), even though we have a silly amount of roms even after 2 years. 

To answer your question, I've mainly stuck to 2 or 3 roms which I know I can trust on a month to month basis. These are: ShapeshiftOS (currently without a maintainer since PavanPaps left), Pixel experience and ArrowOS. All 3 are pretty good in their own right and give me what I want to use.

 Some other roms which I don't use very often but I know are good are: SyberiaOS, YAAP, Project Radiant, etc. 

One thing you need to keep in mind is that any rom right now that tells you that it needs *A11 firmware* will almost certainly have poor battery life. This is unfortunately apparently a drawback of this new firmware."

I know the hardness scale is roughly the same on almost all phone displays, but I wonder if there is a small enough difference in hardness that it happens to fall within that narrow window where one side is just soft enough and the other is just hard enough.

2586,Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro review megathread,ilive12,11037,2021-10-25 16:46:25,"Actually some reviews are already saying the opposite. Pixel 6 has the same or slightly better battery than the 6 Pro. Even with slightly bigger battery at variable refresh rate, it's a lot higher resolution and size which just eats up battery.

There are real reasons that the Pro costs more, and could maybe be worth those costs to some people, but those reasons aren't worth it for me.

90hz is a huge improvement over 60hz, but 120 isn't a huge improvement over 90. 12 vs 8gb of RAM are not going to make a difference for 90% of people, and I'm not a power user. Tele and ultrawide selfie are nice things to have but not needs to have. My carrier doesn't even offer millimeter-wave 5g nor does my city so that is useless to me. And battery life doesn't seem like it's actually better on the Pro, maybe the same or slightly worse. 

I like the extra cameras of the Pro, but not for $300 more. Personally also think the 6 itself is already about as big of a phone as I would want. I know some people even wish the 6 was smaller, it's decently bigger screen than the standard iPhone 13 or S21. I also prefer the flat screen.

If they had a non-millimeter wave Pro for $100 less it would maybe be more of a consideration for me."

Pixel 6 pro looks to get about 7-8 compared to it in the only comparison we have on YouTube, and charges faster.

The video is overblown from cherry picked examples in 1 or 2 reviews. I actually got a blind video test wrong and thought pixel was iPhone. In other comparisons the lead iPhone as is very small on the main lens. Pixel also seems to have better video on the front camera and from comparisons I've seen I prefer the main front camera for stills as well. 

Either way, isn't it great we are arguing about what phone is the best in such small details. No one can go wrong with any of these behemoths right now, absolutely amazing camera systems and features in phones. 

I couldn't get the iPhone due to no stock availability so I'm glad the pixel has some advantages and isn't dogshit for video anymore."

Also apparently it won't work when the screen is off so it's a 2 step process to hit power then use the fingerprint reader. Samsung does it in 1 step. I'd bet that gets solved in a future update. I'm also worried about how it works with a glass screen protector. These are just more negatives when coming from my pixel 3 where the reader on the back works flawlessly.

One guy that was doing a live stream yesterday even predicted that the Pixel 6's would probably perform mediocre in battery stress tests because those are less than ordinary circumstances, And that Googles adaptive battery would show itself when you're actually just living with device instead of trying to measure it against the competition for review purposes. 

He said the battery for the 6 Pro was amazing in his own day to day. I'm guessing the fact that these reviewers were in a race against time they were just trying to kill the battery by doing everything and anything within the first couple days and adaptive battery didn't latch on in the right way. This can also be exasperated by the fact that 90% of these reviewers are coming from the greatest battery performer ever; iPhone 13 pro's."

What the Pro gains in having a bigger battery is just enough to cover the fact that it has a higher resolution and bigger screen, I don't think you will get noticeably better battery with one or the other.

But with the Pixel 6 Pro, video shouldn't be running 100% refresh rate, the big feature of the display is that if the video is at 24fps, the Pixel 6 Pro can run at 24hz, whereas the Pixel 6 can only run at 60 or 90hz no matter what is playing on the screen."

Beautiful UI with fun and colorful elements; 5 years of Android updates; newly enabled Voice Typing and on-device voice to text processing are excellent

2793,Google Pixel 6 Pro review,sstokes2746,10918,2021-11-03 19:51:58,"I may be in the minority here, but the 6 (I don't have the pro model) hasn't been as life changing as I thought it would be.  I'm not a professional photographer and use my phone for everyday pictures, so all the hype about the camera doesn't mean much to me. Don't get me wrong, it does take good pictures, but that seems to be one of the major selling points of the phone along with the Tensor chip. I will say that the 6 does seem a little faster than my 4a and 5a, but not by much. 

The battery life is average. I'm not one of those people that expect to get three days of use out of one charge, but it does seem like I'm charging the 6 more than my other Pixels. And let's talk about the finger print sensor. I hate this thing. I get more ""failure to read"" alerts more than anything. I erased my finger print and added it again with about the same results. Samsung and OnePlus are definitely way better in that department. 

Will the 6 or 6 Pro seem amazing if someone has never had another Pixel? Probably.  This is my first ""flagship"" Pixel, and I can't complain about the price ($699 for the 256 gb version), but it seems like I've had better luck with the ""a"" series."
2794,Google Pixel 6 Pro review,filosoful,10918,2021-11-03 17:37:02,"In our display brightness tests, the Google Pixel 6 Pro scored 497 nits of maximum brightness using the manual slider. 

Peak brightness reached 860 nits when set to Adaptive Brightness. These numbers are excellent considering Google's Pixel phones have historically been behind the competition in screen brightness. 

Even so, display panels of current flagships from Apple, Samsung, and vivo have already broken past the 1000 nits mark for peak brightness."

- Battery life hasn't been a problem. Was weirdly concerning on day 1 and 2, but day 3 was 7 hours of taking photos at a wedding and i still had 50% available at end of day. No issues since

- Fingerprint sensor isn't good, but it's better than my S10+ so i'm not unhappy with it. I do miss face unlock (S10+ had it) and i did prefer the rear fingerprint sensor from previous pixels (had a pixel 1 and 3XL before the S10+).

- Camera is great, the S10+ looks like a VGA webcam by comparison. Also looks noticeably better than my wifes Pixel 3 photos (shes getting jelly). 

Overall, very happy with the phone. 20/20 hindsight i would probably have been happy with just the P6, but i got a $200 discount on the pro so not really complaining"

They look way, way softer than previous iterations of pixels due to the increase in sensor size. Same for the front facing camera. The overall response I have to it is that the images look like they could be from any camera. There's no global sharpness anymore, zooming in on foliage looks terrible too.

I shit on pixels for a lot but never for their detail. You can usually zoom into 100% or more and things still look somewhat realistic, not blurry or water painting like."

2800,Google Pixel 6 Pro review,IThatAsianGuyI,10918,2021-11-05 03:19:21,"As someone that's coming from a Pixel 2 XL, here are my quick impressions after just over a week:

* The in-display fingerprint scanner is straight up a downgrade from having a physical one on the back. At best, it's about even with the physical scanner on my 2XL in terms of speed, but more often than not it's both slower and more finicky to actually use. The double tap for notifications is a pretty resounding downgrade compared to swiping down on the physical reader too. Having the in-display is nice for when the phone is sitting down on my desk or something, but the overall step backwards in terms of day-to-day use is a QoL step backwards. 

* Display is a really big upgrade. The 120hz is a huge joy since I have an S7+ tab and it's nice to not have to take a step back when I'm on the go. Nothing scientific, but the display is really bright. I'm not one to max the brightness basically ever either. Not sure how it compares to the top tier displays out there (my girlfriend has the 13 mini and that's not exactly an apples to apples comparison) so won't make any comparative comments. What I will say is I haven't had any difficult reading anywhere with the thing. I thought I would hate the curved display more, but in my usage I havent even noticed it much. Finding a tempered glass screen protector is proving challenging here in Canada so far though. 

* Speakers are straight up just less enjoyable compared to the 2XL's front firing ones IMO. Again, nothing scientific and definitely no maximum loudness tests or anything, but the speakers on the 6 Pro just don't have a sound profile I enjoy. I wouldn't say they're a downgrade or anything, as the base is definitely an improvement, but for me it almost overpowers and takes away from everything else.

* Battery: Maybe I'm an oddball, but I'm getting absolutely amazing battery life out of my 6Pro. It's more or less over double what my 2XL could do. For reference, my 2XL is still on its original battery and manages, roughly 5h SoT. I use Accubattery for history information, but I'm reading now it's not super accurate. I'll double check with GSam and Ampere or whatever else others suggest, but my 2XL is still an all-day phone for me. The 6Pro literally more than doubles that. I get estimated 12hrs SoT on the 6Pro from Accubattery and I believe it. Just finished my second day with the phone and only just charged it. Got through my second work day without charging and went from 80% to 24%. Small charges in my car with it's wireless charging pad to and from work, but otherwise I'm very impressed. I did turn off 5G (as it's basically non existent here in my part of Canada) though. 

* That leads me into Android 12. Pretty mixed overall. Changes to things like battery usage info from last full charge to last 24 hours, the quick access buttons, notification tray going from a curtain like overlay with the current screen info remaining visible to straight up covering up the current screen are big steps back in terms of enjoyment. Like the swipe left or swipe right from the edge to the middle to go back, absolutely detest the gesture-based home and multitasking windows. Don't like the inability to choose system UI colors and are limited to what the phone thinks is good with my wallpapers (and all of them being pastels). 

* Camera, truthfully haven't taken too many photos/videos yet for an impression. The few photos I have taken have been impressive to me though. 

Overall, I would say it's a big upgrade to my 2XL, but some of the QoL things are definitely an annoyance. It's not the slam dunk upgrade I had hoped like my 2XL was for my Xperia 1, but overall I'm still pretty happy."
2801,Google Pixel 6 Pro review,blahtender,10918,2021-11-04 02:06:18,"Posting on a Pixel 6 Pro.

Lots of people in this thread comparing it to the S21 and iPhone 13, leaving out that it's $300+ less than those phones. 

Not trying to be a fan boy. I'm pretty happy with my phone. I've run into some hiccups that I'm not sure are hardware or software related. 

Lots of stuttering on loading ads. It's weird. Again, probably software. My guy tells me it's a little bit of both.

I've had it freeze on me for a couple minutes, but couldn't hold down the power button to reset, because it just keep activating Google assistant. I'm probably missing a hard shut off process here. It did recover.

I feel like this may be a one off, but it wouldn't turn on when I initially received it, I brought it into a VZW store and it turned on first try. Weird issue, but haven't had to service it at all otherwise. 

My interpretation of all this is that Google had a lot of software updates to get this phone to what they want it to be. Hopefully, they know it's pivotal to their success in the market. 

That said, if this phone turns out to be everything it's hardware and promising software updates project it to be, I'm down to buy the pixel 8 pro."

I can't get any other refresh rate, this sounds like a big chance to improve battery assuming it's a bug and can/will be fixed (and not an issue with the tool).

Why isn't it frame matching? 60hz on a static screen of text seems a waste of battery and 60hz for 24fps content both a waste of battery and worse to watch"

We can hopefully tweak the processing to leave more shadows and avoid the noise. Didn't everyone bitch about google keeping shadows too dark on the previous pixels?  

I prefer to keep highlights muted though. I always turn highlights down on keeper photos, but that's a preference. I just think it makes a photo look more dramatic. I always loved how pixels will never blow out the sky on a bright day. I can't stand seeing photos with a bright subject and all white sky. I'll take an underexposed subject with the whole scene properly exposed over that."

My 3+ year old phone unlocks instantly with a scanner on the back of the phone which provides tactile feedback as to where it is... I'm not going to a fingerprint scanner that (I've heard) can take up to 0.5-1 second to unlock (above and beyond the fact there's no tactile way to know my finger is in the right position without looking at the phone).

Google motto might as well be 'if it ain't broke, break it"". Idk anyone who ever complained about the rear fingerprint scanner but hey that's ugly and old... let's lose that and add a big ass camera bar on the back, that's trendy right?

The battery life has been amazing for me. I'm an average user. It's been unplugged since 7am this morning, now at 4:30pm and getting out of work with moderate usage, I'm at 76%. That's unheard of in my eyes.

The finger print sensor is a tad annoying. I've actually double-scanned all of my fingers and I think it may have helped a little bit. (ie. I have two copies of my right and left thumb, making 4 fingers). 

I don't regret my purhcase, it's mad speedy IMHO. I used to be CRAZY about specs and such. Do I think the iPhone is better? Sure, quite a bit, actually. Does this Pixel give the iPhone a run for it's money? Hell yeah. I love this damn thing."
2847,Google Pixel 6 Pro review,cdegallo,10918,2021-11-03 21:49:23,"I think speculators and enthusiasts hyped the camera a lot more than google did.  I felt pretty underwhelmed with what google actually showed off in the pixel event where they mostly only showcased face unblur and skin tone mapping (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), and then a tiny bit on HDR net for HDR videos.

Video is noticeably better to me vs. the previous pixels--which isn't necessarily a reason to buy the 6 even if you have an existing pixel.

Even with other brands that have used ""cutting edge"" sensor technology--take the S21 ultra--even with its big sensor and large 9x binned super-pixels, even all of that was only just incrementally better than google camera on pixels, and generally limited to the detail and noise under some circumstances.  Keep in mind, I'm limiting this to just the main sensor results--I completely understand that the S21 u offered a wider variety of camera modules and different capabilities of the camera modules.  But even then--I had the S21 u since launch and unless it was some well-lit outdoor landscape shot, my wife's pixel 3 would produce better and more consistent shots far more frequently than my s21u would.  Mark LeVoy, who worked on google camera and its computational approach, even said that with the current sensors available to phones, even the newest and most-favorable property ones, will only produce very incremental improvements.  

I think it was mostly just unmanaged expectations from outsiders seeing all of the rumors over the past few months.

Regarding the fingerprint sensor, I've had the opposite experience--my 6 pro has been reliable and fast (well, fast given how fast optical scanners can be), and the one on my s21 u would frequently throw errors.  I do wonder if google has some bugs in the scanner or software that weren't caught, given the discrepancies between users, since there are a ton of people also reporting bad experiences like yours."

Because exactly zero of those things precludes still delivering ""great all around performance.""  We're so over-powered with SOC capabilities vs. what apps and services demand and have been for years that even a 60% throttling situation makes no practical difference.

Hell my pixel 4 XL with the SD855 has no practical perceivable performance difference across a wide array of different uses than my SD888 S21 ultra.  

None of this matters, and it's borderline hilarious to see people in this sub, and people in tech review sites, make such a big deal over things that have virtually no impact to the overall customer experience.

I've had the 6 pro for about 5 days now and even in the controversial topic of power consumption and battery life it achieves the same battery life I was getting on my SD888 S21 ultra.

It's clocked lower and the cache latency is much worse than SD888 and Exynos 2100.

>with multi core scores even less than SD865 and really poor sustained performance falling to as low as 60%

Multi core is poor because of Google using A76 cores instead of A78.

Throttling is due to Google not gluing display to the midframe. This makes an air gap between SoC and display and there's nowhere for the heat to go, causing high temps and throttling.

Almost every other device uses screen as a giant heatsink.

>Infact for gaming, GSMArena itself noted that other smartphones will be better suited for playing graphic intensive games for longer sessions.

>And yet says in pros section - ""excellent graphics performance""

The GPU throttles very heavily too. This is a 20 core G78 GPU and yet the performance is same as 14 core in Exynos 2100 or lower after throttling.

It's just that the performance is more than enough for mobile games, so real world performance is more than enough even throttled."

I would imagine it would do things like shutting down apps or limit their background activity over time based on you when you used them.  Maybe adjust brightness settings a little better to save battery when maybe you dont need it that bright, or batch some updates together when it knows you're on wifi or whatever. 

But I don't imagine any of those things would effect a test that just runs down the battery by playing a video over and over. Or browsing the web over and over or placing a phone call for 13 hours straight or whatever.

You'd need to simulate like the daily use case of the average person. Send a few texts, expect some texts back.  Place a phone call or seven. Swipe the tinder a bit, left then right. Browse the web while taking your afternoon shit. Watch some youtubes followed by your daily dosage of LSF austin streamer drama. Plug your phone into your car for Android Auto for an hour. Maybe some on foot navigation afterward. Some more tinder messages. Some more texts. A duo call to mom, tell her you're looking forward to her thanksgiving roast, etc. I feel like theres room for optimization there with some kind of AI adaptive thingy. Just playing a video though? Idk what adaptive AI thing is going to improve that. It's a fixed power cost for the screen, hardware decoder, etc. It's not like the AI is going to suddenly improve the H265 codec the movie is using or something or like load the webpage a little more optimally, or turn that 3G call GSM is using and AI modulate it for lower power, etc."

apple doesn't glue their midframe, and their thermals are fine. even though their soc and display efficiency is much much better, i really don't think the display bonding plays any significant role in the p6's thermals, something else is causing the blunt of it.

in fact, apple may doing it intentionally so that the display runs cooler. their display does get brighter than any same-gen display out there (@100% apl). oled brightness is artificially limited by heat and power constraints, so apple is allowing it to get brighter and dealing with the tradeoffs."

The understanding currently is that pixel drops are an exclusive subset of the Android OS features, so a new OS comes paired with pixel-only features.

The material is more opaque (compared to LTPS) so it improves transmittance (less light is lost).  Lower oxide TFT discharge also means that, for the same refresh, the display can pulse at a lower current to achieve the same steady-state luminance as an LTPS TFT.

Increased power efficiency and less heat should allow the display to be driven at a higher brightness for the same power/thermals."

Okay...?  I don't know what you're getting at here, are you asking for proof or something?

>And somehow in every case, 6 Pro comes out at top.

Nope, that's not at all what I'm saying.  I'm not saying, nor did I say, that the pixel 6/6 pro is without technical faults.  What I am saying is that there are few--if any--practical connections to user experience from the technical gaps that are found in these analyses.

>then why even put a Tensor SOC in there?

I don't know, I didn't make the phone.  For one thing, google probably wants to get away from Snapdragon and the corresponding licensing requirements.  I can almost guarantee, though, that the choices were probably made with a balance of cost and necessary performance.  As I said before, the performance provided by highest-end tech to current apps and services is very much overkill and has been for at least two years.  Older tech is cheaper, cheaper components means either lower retail cost or higher margins.  Both of which benefit the manufacturer of a device.

>It was Google who promised sun and the moon while launching Tensor

You are reading too much into what google actually said.

> This much faster than this, that...

Do you realize that they were comparing it against the pixel 5, which is already a laughable comparison to make.  And yet it's still not untrue...

>It is terrible thing to promise a sports car and then deliver some cheap hyundai.

And let's praise Duarte that isn't happening.

>if SD 855 wasn't more than enough in it's time, it wouldn't be still okay at this moment.

They're not. Apple throttles to less than half their peak performance. It's just that they are on an insane TSMC node that the efficiency is so good and peak performance is so high.

>in fact, apple may doing it intentionally so that the display runs cooler. their display does get brighter than any same-gen display out there (@100% apl). oled brightness is artificially limited by heat and power constraints, so apple is allowing it to get brighter and dealing with the tradeoffs.

3018,Google Pixel 6 Pro review,RegularCircumstances,10918,2021-11-04 06:40:33,"The 12 to 13 saw the inclusion of a massively improved OLED emitter technology in the panel that improved not only battery life but allowed Apple to boost the peak brightness given lower thermal outputs across the curve. I can’t overstate* [edit from understate] just how important this alone is. 

Second, the 13 Pro & Pro Max include LTPO displays, and with LFD/VRR, the power consumption at lower fresh rate: (so for video or reading) lowers power consumption further, though with 90-120HZ across UI menu’s, the 13 & 13 Pro are both similar in improvement & absolute efficiency, 13 Pro having a slightly smaller battery however. The Pixel 6 Pro’s LTPO or even regular E5 rigid display are simply not as efficient. https://twitter.com/andreif7/status/1455577873209864198?s=21


All iPhone 13 batteries are 8-18% larger across the board. To your inquiry, the 12PM (presumably you meant this & not the regular 12) was at 3687 mAh, —>> 4352 with the 13PM. This is yet smaller than the Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro for that matter. Smaller in watt hours too. Not a win for the iPhone here, at least in isolation.

Lastly, as if to rub salt in the wound, they utilize an X60 modem & new antenna module in the 13 models, as opposed to the garbage X55 modem in the 12 series. The X60 is on Samsung 5NM and supports a greater number of bands & SA 5G implementations as well as being dramatically more efficient. New antenna module may help as well. By contrast the Samsung Modem in the Pixel 6 lineup is speculated to be similar to the X55. Ouch.

A15 is less power efficient but more energy efficient for a given workload. 

Stack these and it’s no shock the iPhone 13 takes my Pixel 6 to the woodshed on battery life. Love the Pixel’s software, camera, Google Assistant, design (other than sheer size itself) and the display’s color representation, those are a boon to my impressions. But it’s pathetic how much better my IP13 (is not even a Pro or Pro Max, just regular) is when battery size/display size scaling we see ought to give the Pixel 6 an advantage. It does no such thing here."

3024,Google Pixel 6 Pro review,NamesTheGame,10918,2021-11-04 00:35:55,I went from pixel 2 to 6 and yeah. Not much different but it's bigger and heavier and my battery is good again. If you don't obsess over battery stress tests and low light camera comparisons it's going to be a very minimal change in your life. If I wasn't lazy I might have fixed the cracked camera lens and replaced the battery on my 2 and frankly would have liked it more than the 6.
3025,Google Pixel 6 Pro review,Atmos312,10918,2021-11-08 14:06:49,"I went 2 XL -> 6 Pro and honestly think I'm going to return the 6 Pro (or sell it) and either deal with the 2 XL for another year, or buy a 128gb Pixel 6 as a stop-gap and upgrade to a Pixel 7 next year if they improve some things with it. 

Is it better than the 2 XL? Of course, but it's not as amazing as I thought the 4 year gap would be. 

* Android 12 is fine, looks great but there are some weird choices that annoy me.
* Performance is great, no problems with how fast the phone is.
* 120hz screen is good, but I went back to my 2 XL for a few hours and was fine with it. It is a lot brighter though which is great. Cooler white balance compared to my 2 XL.
* Pictures are okay? Dynamic range is great but Google's processing since the 2 XL has changed a lot and I'm not a fan of how heavy handed they went with the HDR and sharpening. I do like the telephoto, but is it worth $300 to get it? Not so sure.  
* Battery is obviously good again, but not fantastic so far. Not sure how people are ending the day with like 50-60% unless they never use their phone. 
* Fingerprint is downgrade, not as fast or accurate.

Few other things too but I guess I was expecting too much and have just a bit of buyer's remorse after spending $1000 on this thing (for the 256gb version). If I can sell it to cover what I paid or even make a tiny bit off it I'll probably do that. Pixel 6 at $599 is definitely the better deal though."

For most people they're probably going to use the same type A or maybe a basic type C one. They've used their whole lives. I would wager to say that for most people incredibly fast charging is typically a more power user-oriented feature. 

So not manufacturing millions of new bricks for people to use when they probably already have some that are good enough in a drawer. Somewhere makes a lot of sense.

As a consumer, it pisses me off. Obviously, I'd rather just have more bricks and I'd rather just have more faster charging and I'd rather get that all for free. When I buy my $1,000 phone. But devil's advocate I can see where they're coming from."

If the in screen scanner is as fast as (or nearly as fast as) the scanner on my phone now? I'd put up with not having the tactile feedback to locate the sensor like I have now with the rear mounted sensor... But the compounded issues make me question whether it's worth making those compromises."

Apple also uses M series displays, not E5. And M13 should be in production.

If there was a note this year, it would have it. You can bet the S22 Ultra will also hit 1100 nits.

https://twitter.com/OfficialAmagora/status/1319605064504397824?s=19

My guess is Marques was basing the quality off of the detail and contrast. I also assume his idea of a good portrait is one where the phone can determine the subject you really want. Like the fact the Pixel blurs the camera out means it has a better subject focus and choosing of subjects. The iPhone loses the quality a lot by comparison but it puts both the camera and Marques as the subjects. By comparison the Pixel blows the iPhone out of the water with sharpness and color (imo) but I personally like that the iPhone 12 captures both marques and the camera in the same shot."

3177,[MKBHD] Google Pixel 5 Review: Software Special!,aneesimran1,10386,2020-10-24 16:41:53,"Yes and no.

How I see it as the pixel 4 XL being another option alongside the pixel 5. They both have pros and cons.

I had the pixel 4 XL and I switched to the pixel 5.

The reasons why I did that was, firstly the weight and compact size is just so perfect for my hands at least, 4XL was heavier and slightly uncomfortable for me to use.

Secondly, the battery life is far superior.

Thirdly, I loved face unlock but barely any apps supported it, they supported finger print only (i.e. my bank app) so FP makes more sense on Android at least.

Also, the display is a lot nicer, brighter, less black crush and even looks nicer on lower brightness.

Finally, the video recording especially in the audio was a massive jump.

But the 4XL had pros, like I think the telephoto was a more useful lens, better haptics, better speaker setup (sound quality), and better raw performance ( another reason I decided to keep P5, as I don't game and didn't notice any difference)"

Cause they use it as second-hand buttplugs.

No, for real though, I completely agree. Vibration motor is literally a smaller-level frill. I appreciate it being better, but I never really ever think about it or care. Then again, I never have vibration off for anything else than notifications/calling. Even on iPhones, the haptic feedback when for example typing feels extremely obnoxious and unnatural. It's so damn obvious that I'm not pushing a button, and *that specific* button--I've never gotten why people like it so much. It's the same with their touchpads on Macbooks, which were replaced from physical buttons to haptic feedback, when clicking. People praise the latter, but I absolutely hate it. It's nowhere close to resembling the actual, true feel of a click, and is not as tactile.

And I'm not even a mechnical keyboard fanatic or anything (in fact, I like mushy membranes)."

How about we conduct another test, where it's off by default. Let's then see how many actually turn it on.

It is definitely a ""reset"" and full push into minimalism, including the squeeze to assist feature.

They're definitely paying attention though, so make sure to comment and let them know on their socials that you want these features. At this moment they're working on the Pixel 6 and this is the time when features are being considered."

I also disabled some stuff like AOD. To have good battery life in the Pixel 4 I had to disable some things. And now I got used to it so in the 5 I'm getting amazing battery.

But I'm not doing a lot of crazy stuff....the main tweak I did is to disable Always ON. The other tweaks are minimal. 

On my first cycle I got 7.5 hours. So this is variable.

But iOS is probably created to consume the less energy as possible. I mean the iPhone 11 pro has 3046mAh. That's not a huge battery in my opinion. But iOS is more focused in battery life. 

I think Android needs to improve this in the standby time.

Active battery drain was never a big deal for me. If I use the device non stop (something quite difficult to do) I end up with tremendous SoT even in a Pixel 4. Now if you want to add 24/48 or more hours of standby into this, then other stuff end up killing the battery."

I'm not sure if the adaptive battery has kicked in yet or will but so far it will get me through a day with _moderate_ usage and about 30% left.

You might prefer only the background to not be in focus but if an object is in front of what you're focusing on - Marques' face in this case - well...

Perhaps you can share some battery screenshots so I can analyse? 
Both ""Show full device usage"" and ""Show app usage"".

It could also be possible if you were using the camera a lot. Like a video conference, photos, videos.

I've used my phone on first cycle till it reached 1% and finally turned off.

If we are really going to be nitpicky, you could say the same thing about the iPhone photo. How is it that some of the background with the building is blurred but other parts with the building aren't? Yes the pixel's photo isn't perfect, and since they are right there in front of us, the lens ring could be blurred, but the software at least recognizes what needs to be appropriately blurred compared to iPhone software.

It just seems like the pixel software has a better understanding of what needs to be in and out of focus overall."

And if you aren't using lot of hidden stuff like [GPS / Voice calls / Video calls etc] it doesn't look that bad. 

How is your standby time battery impact? I wonder if you don't use the screen, if it's still goes down quickly. (Shouldn't). 

If you want some of my settings: 
 
- 1) I disabled ""OK Google"" because I always tap the assistant button (and at home I have a Home mini).
- 2) I only enable Bluetooth when I need to sync my fitbit tracker. So bluetooth is off. 
- 3) I'm not using ""Now Playing""
- 4) ""Bluetooth Scanning"" = OFF. (Under location). 
- 5) Preferred Network Type: 4G ( I don't think this does something. My carrier doesn't have 5G anyway). (If your issue is standby related. You could try Prefer 3G just for testing purposes). Or you could try dev settings and set ""Mobile Data Always Active"" to OFF (if you use WiFi all the time). 
- 6) I use the tap to wake function but I don't enable the ""lift to wake"". (And that other option that turns ON the screen after any notification).  
- 7) Restricted apps, for now is just Instagram. ( I also disable Notifications and background data for Instagram). This is the only ""difficult"" setting I tried so far. I'd do it to any Facebook app (except WhatsApp, because is critical). Generally I restrict a lot of apps (Pixel 4) but in the Pixel 5 I only restricted Instagram as the device is new. 

All these settings are quite ""soft"" and I don't really think they will impact your battery life. But is something you might want to try.

One more thing. If you used to have a Pixel 2 or Pixel 4, and now you are experiencing like at least 50% more battery life. Then I don't think the problem is the device, and it's something else. 
Now if you tell me you had Pixel 2 or 4, and now with the 5, you have the same battery life. Then I'd say there can be a problem with the device.
The guy who (i think) owns ""Android Police"", always has terrible battery life, no matter the device. So I'm sure if he grabs a Pixel 5, he would have little battery life compared to other people.

Edit: Oh and also try to reach a battery shutdown. My Pixel 4 went crazy in the last weeks, and 1% was actually like...15%. i was having 30-40 minutes SoT at 1%...Hopefully is fixed with a factory reset. 

I remembered something else. You can also try disable RCS. Currently I have it enabled on the Pixel 5 and battery was great ( this is Messages --> Chat Features). but in the past I used to remove it because ""Carrier Services"" was appearing the battery menu."

In four generations, Google has yet to do anything special with its hardware. It mostly just produces cookie-cutter smartphones at a very high price, doing the same thing as other companies often a year or two behind the competition. Google's few attempts at building something different have all been failures. Google tried building a custom camera co-processor with the Pixel Visual Core, but then it never used it in its own camera app. The company tried cloning Apple's face unlock system with the Pixel 4, but it built a slow, unreliable system that shipped with security issues other vendors fixed years ago. It tried integrating in-house technology with Project Soli, but that was never meant for smartphones and doesn't work very well anyway. For Google, deeper control over the hardware has mostly just been an avenue to screw up the hardware.

3422,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",mrkhiggz,9896,2019-11-17 19:34:57,"I was looking to upgrade to the Pixel 4XL this year from a Pixel 2. Before that I was on a Nexus 6P and a S4 before that. But as Ron put it, Google just seemed out of touch with this one. And for someone like myself who isn't a huge picture taker the camera didn't add as much value to me as it does others. I considered getting a Pixel 3a XL instead, but that was more a side grade for me if not a down grade. What I was really looking for in a phone was timely updates, with a responsive interface. Because I couldn't justify the price of the Pixel 4 for my use case, I decided that for the first time in 9 years of smartphones, I was strongly considering an iPhone. 

 
I ended up going to my local Apple Store about 10 minutes from my home to look at some and mess with them. After talking to a sales person and telling them how I have been nine year Android user, that I was able to buy an iPhone and return it for any reason. He even admitted that iOS and its limitations aren't for everyone, but said that once you really use it for as a daily driver you can really tell how much, if at all, these limitations will effect you. 

I decided that would give one a shot since I could always return it. He asked me what model I was thinking of. He recommended I get the iPhone 11 but after I said I don't take many pictures he changed his recommendation to a XR. Since they were practically the same phone otherwise which is the phone I ended up with. (XR with 128GB for $650)

Having a store front is something I think Google is underestimating. This was the least stressful phone purchase I have ever made. What made it so much less stressful was knowing that I had a place I could return it, know that I have a place to make a warranty claim, and even though their prices are terrible in the Apple Store, I have a place if I were ever to need a last minute accessory. After reading all the horror stories through the years of people not getting their phones from Google when buying online has had me very hesitant when considering them.

I hope to be able to go back to Android in the future as there are a few feature I do miss from Android like being able to access my phones storage via USB and with what they are doing with RCS, but with the latest Pixel launch and not really caring for most of Samsung's offerings, I felt it was finally time I gave Apple a chance and unfortunately for Google and surprising to me, I can't say I am unhappy on iOS at this time."
3423,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",,9896,2019-11-17 19:18:18,The one thing they messed up badly is the price. If it was cheaper it would be a decent buy. Honestly I can see it being the pixel 4a.
3424,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",niggo372,9896,2019-11-17 16:30:17,"I bought a Pixel 4 and really struggle with the discrepancies between reviews and my personal experience. For me the phone has been a total blast: Great build quality, buttery smooth performance, awesome photos, surprisingly good sound, solid battery life, and so on. Sure it wasn't the cheapest, but I got a 129€ Nest Hub for free (that I wanted to get for my kitchen anyway), so I actually paid about 620€ for the phone itself, not too bad.

Maybe my perception of what modern phones should be capable of is a bit outdated coming from the Pixel 1, although I play around with other people's phones all the time. For me the experience has been nothing but enjoyable, and the price was pretty reasonable all things considered. I buy Pixel for the camera, guaranteed updates, streamlined Android experience and newest Google features, and that's exactly what I got.

Idk, maybe I am becoming a Pixel sheep. :/"

I had thought about getting the 3a, but it seems like the 3xl (would consider the regular 3 but heard horrible battery life) will be steeply discounted coming up. Would that be an upgrade over my current OP6? I really want a great camera that can take consistently good shots, good battery life (like, I can go all day without having to worry unless maybe I use it hard), and smooth operating/good screen. Those are the most important things to me. I think I could live with a dongle, though it's not ideal.

3448,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",markyymark13,9896,2019-11-17 17:30:30,"Forget competing and copying Apple for a moment. Google can't even make a competitive phone against the likes of Samsung, among others. I mean seriously, I've been using Samsung phones, and some LG phones, for some years now and high refresh rate screen aside, they offer *nothing* that's really competitive or compelling for me to jump to Pixel, even though I would have loved to if given the chance.

IMO ""stock Android"" is not enough of a selling point on it's own when the rest of your phone is so uncompetitive. Not to mention, Samsung's One UI and other skins like Oxygen OS, Zen UI, etc. has gotten so good and is packed with features stock Android doesn't have that the ""stock Android experience"" is quickly becoming a joke because Google is just coasting on their phones.

My last takeaway is their ecosystem, or lack thereof, and other accessories and hardware. Google has flopped on accessories like headphones and watches, as well as their laptops and tablets. Making it a tougher sell for me personally to jump from Samsung to Google when Samsung's accessories and other hardware blend so well together.

Get your shit together Google"
3449,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",cdegallo,9896,2019-11-17 16:36:09,"One point where my experience disagrees with the article is on this:

>Face unlock—Slow, unreliable, and frustrating

I haven't experienced any of the issues they mentioned, and face unlock is just as fast as FP scanners on my other phones.  The only instance where the face unlock doesn't work at all is when the sun is shining from directly in front of me.

They also allude to security issues with it, but I don't agree that they are.

My response regarding the 4 XL in a thread from r/googlepixel where someone was advocatong that the 4 is a near-perfect phone (::scoff::):

>I have the 4 XL.  I don't dislike it, but it's far from near perfect.

>Very poor audio recording quality in videos.  Lackluster video quality.  While Google camera still performance is good, Google is years behind other flagships in video recording.  On mine, if I record my wife and son 18 inches across a table from me, their voices sound like they are 15 feet away, it's ridiculous.

>Brightness on the 4 XL seems to be better than previous years, it's still not on par with phones that have comfortable outdoor viewing (and even a high brightness mode that is not enabled).

>Motion sense feels like something someone early on in the phone development got into the phone, then left mid-development, with super barebones implementation and options.  I turned it off, too many accidental unlocks and skips.

>90hz implementation and screen calibration feels horribly lazy, with incorrect gamma curves being applied under some conditions (leading to the green or purple tint that some users have reported).

>Battery life is basically adequate.  Enough for a day for me, but none of the comfort that I've grown accustomed to with other recent flagships.

>Far from perfect, especially for the asking price."

Best camera IMO. 90hz is great. Brightness isn't even issue and the display is gorgeous even coming from Samsung.

Battery life is behind competition yeah but it's at least 6 hours SOT, who really needs more than that? I don't.

The matte glass and coating feel amazing in the hand.

Doesn't have an ultra wide but I don't like those shots anyway the quality from the iPhone and Samsung ultra wides isn't anything to brag about. I'd rather have the super zoom which is magical.

You can argue it's overpriced due to hardware specs but Pixel 4 brings many things to the table that you can't get on any other smartphone. I don't think it's over priced at all. It's just trendy to hate on things in the tech reviewer community. If the biggest complaint is battery life which can get 7 hours of SOT then they must be really struggling for things to moan about"

3529,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",speedlever,9896,2019-11-17 19:30:28,"I want to replace my 3+ year old phone soon. I would love to like the P4. But I don't. Like iPhones, the P4 just doesn't represent value to me, especially for nearly the same money as an iPhone which has far superior local support (store) and extended iOS updates without carrier intervention. Maybe the iPhone will be more tempting to me when they ditch the lightning connector and go with a USB-C connector. But there are some applications I use which I haven't found replacements for in iOS (WiFiAnalzer and Blokada, for example).

Regardless, I took a chance 3 years ago when I bought my current OnePlus 3. It was an unknown to me other than a rather esoteric enthusiast phone. And Oxygen Operating System was a total unknown to me. But in the last 3 years, OP has made a believer out of me and OOS is one of the strong suits of the phone now. My OP3 still performs acceptably.

I had planned to go Nexus in 2016, but then Pixel happened and I was not impressed with the phone for the price when the OG Pixel was announced. I ordered the OP3 the same day and have been delighted with it.

I don't care to buy carrier phones and have the OS updates filtered through the carrier. I don't have any viable current Android options that meet my desires. I'm tempted by the OP7T Pro, but it isn't sold in the US except as a TMO exclusive with the McLaren edition. Nope, not gonna do that even though there are work arounds for the carrier updates.

The radar features of the P4 sound the same as the Galaxy S4 I bought back in 2013. That was fun for about 5 minutes and then I disabled that feature and never used it again. The P4 just doesn't appeal to me on any level, even aesthetically. Well, except for updates coming straight from Google. It's just too little phone for too much money IMO and severely lacks value to me.

I've pretty much decided to wait for the spring 2020 phones to come out before making a purchase. But the leaks I've seen thus far don't excite me. OnePlus with a punch hole camera? I'd rather have the popup camera since I don't use the front camera very much and would prefer a clean display.

Perhaps I'm too finicky, but nothing out there really grabs my attention at this point. Apparently, I may have to 'settle' and compromise on one or another of my preferences."
3530,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",Ashanmaril,9896,2019-11-17 19:31:10,">The one real advantage the Pixel 4's Assistant has is that it brings ""Continued Conversation"" to smartphones. You have to enable this in the settings, but continued conversation means the phone will continue listening for a short time after you issue a voice command. This allows you to issue follow-up commands, which work well thanks to the Google Assistant's contextually aware voice input. Once you ask something like ""what's the weather today?"" you can ask a follow-up question like ""How about tomorrow?"" Despite that second command not mentioning ""weather,"" the Google Assistant is smart enough to figure out the context and show you a forecast.

Hasn't this existed for a while? I have this in my Assistant settings on my Pixel 3, although it's not a toggle, it just says that it'll turn the microphone back on after a response, even though it doesn't seem to? Regardless, the part about being able to say ""how about tomorrow"" and it keeping the context has definitely been around for a while now."

If you are looking for a new phone I would recommend the OP7T over the Pixel 4. 

---------------------------

I took the time to watch about 10+ comparison videos of these two phones. This video was the best review comparing the pros and cons. Neither phone is perfect and they trade punches 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPh74mH3620


The OP7T  has a faster CPU, faster and more ram, fingerprint reader, has a brighter larger screen, more consistent 90hz refresh, more base storage, louder speaker, has an alert slider, has a wide angle camera, has a bigger battery, has faster wired charging, better microphones and cheaper. 

The Pixel camera is better, higher resolution screen on the Pixel 4XL, has wireless charging, IP rating, fuller sounding speakers, front radar and all the new google software  features.

Unless you ABSOLUTELY need the best low light camera, then the OP7T is better in almost every way."

Pixel phones exist to make good camera software exclusive to Google phones. Instead of benefiting Android as a whole, Google makes these trash products that copy Apple a year or two later - including all the hardware feature removals. My new phone has an in-display fingerprint sensor, headphone jack and micro SD expansion. All of these features have no reason not to be on the pixel 4.

I could not connect once I was reset and only on Android 10. So that is very annoying. Since you can't role back the Pixel 4, I wouldn't be able to upgrade and have wifi at work.

But I loved GCam on it and that alone made it worth it.

Since then, people having been porting GCam for other phones and I use ported GCam on my new Note and have the best of both worlds. Also all companies are learning that camera software is the way to go and Apple and Samsung now have their version of GCam hdr's computational photography. GCam on pixel is still the best imo, but the others are catching up.

Also as for updates, I use Nova launcher anyways so I didn't even notice most of the Android updates I'd get. I know a lot is under the hood but the things people get excited about are the UI changes, and if you use a launcher, you won't see many differences between updates.

I don't know if this is the case but it really feels like Google has one leg in one leg out like with a lot of their software. That's really not gonna cut it for competing with the likes of Samsung, or even cross platform with apple, and it shows with their dull phone."

Admittedly, when it comes to smart phones, my household is not price-sensitive.  My wife has the latest iPhone and I have the latest Pixel XL.  They're always great and this year, it'll be hard to choose one, but how many people are really going to be switching platform this year?  If you want the best phone for your platform, you know which phone to go with.

In my daily use, Pixel 4XL has no problems with battery life... at all.    I run it at always 90Hz and it's heck a lot better than P3XL.  The bevel is never a thought unless I start reading useless reviews or opinion pieces.  Move on.  Bezel talk is so 2017.  

Advise to Google:  stop screwing around with your basic specs with Pixel 5.   128GB storage, 8 or 10GB memory, fastest Qualcom CPU available should just be standard.  You're penny wise but pound foolish.  Your minimalism tendency has already bitten you hard on Pixel 3.   That phone with only 4GB memory stutter and slow down all the time, especially with Android Auto on, and just total dogshit not even a year after it's release.

 What Google has created (or acquired) is really special and they did a great job at capturing the market but now, they really needs to see the writing on the wall and get their shit together. People in this thread are already thinking of switching to iPhones (some already have), how long before the average consumer also realises this? 5 years, maybe 10?

Given that iPhones are generally marketed better than Android counterparts anyways and with the rise in awareness around privacy (and how Google is basically harvesting identifiable data), they really need to pick up their game.

Availability was very poor, as the phone was only sold in a handful of countries compared to the world-dominating distribution networks of Apple and Samsung. At a whopping $650, the original Pixel phone was shockingly expensive compared to the awesome value previously provided by the Nexus line.

The Pixel line is no different than the Nexus line. They just slapped a flagship price on a Nexus. If they returned to Nexus pricing, these phones would be game changes."

3682,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",Kurger-Bing,9896,2019-11-17 23:37:27,"But like with RAM management, Google fails to deliver battery management comparable to even OEMs like Samsung, Xiaomi and OnePlus. If you provide low specs, you are at the very least expected to make up for it with great software. It works with the old IMX363 camera sensor, but not with the RAM, not with the battery, not with the UFS 2.1, not with the older OLED, etc.

Google are seriously some of the most worst phone designers out there. The smaller Pixel has always had unacceptably low battery life; Pixel 3 battery life was underwhelming, Pixel 3 XL was ""okay"". So what does Google decide to do next year? Increase the battery size of the 4 XL, but reduce it on the 4...Of course the end result is going to be disastrous! 

And it's not like a bigger battery couldn't fit, as comparing it to other phones with the same volume (height, length and thickness) show. The S10e, for example, is thinner, noticeably shorter, has bigger screen-to-body ratio and has a headphone jack. Despite all that it still manages to fit a 3100 mAh battery vs. the 2800 mAh in the Pixel 4. 

We also know for a fact that Samsung OLEDs are among the best in the world, and newer generation panels improve regularly. But that's a no-no for Google. Not only do they go for the quality-wise inferior LG OLED on the Pixel 4, but even the 4 XL is using the last-gen Samsung OLEDs. Because of decisions like these, it affects things like peak brightness being lower and imposition of a 60-90Hz variation that ruins a smooth UX and display quality (thankfully recent update ""fixed"" that): Cornercut-ception


**TL;DR:** Google consciously decide to not increase battery size, when they can. They also provide some of the smallest batteries compared to flagship phone size, in the industry. They fail to provide newer displays that, other than having higher visual quality, are also more power efficient. They fail to even match other OEMs, like Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus and others, in battery efficiency, even after under-clocking their SoC (by ~15%).

Pixel 4 is an example of why specification does matter, especially in areas where software mitigation is lacking. Pixel 3 was the same in regards to RAM, but also to a relevant extent to battery. Pixel 2 in relation to display. And on and on it continues."

While many people assumed Google would whip this team into shape like it did with Motorola, it seems more like the opposite happened.

Every year a new piece of ""me too"" hardware comes out, and every year it feels like something the competition was building one or two years ago. The price is sky high, and this is yet another year of the company standing still when the competition is better than ever.

In my family, me and my dad own the 1st gen pixel and pixel xl, my sister has the 3, and my brother in law the 3xl, and I booked a 3a for my mom today. The main priority for all 4 of them has always been a phone that runs smooth and a camera that delivers top notch pictures, and Google always gets that right. 

But personally, I've been so dissapointed by some of the decisions taken by Google in terms of Pixel devices (pricing, notches, battery compromises, display issues, A/B testing dark mode on my Pixel, etc. For Pixel 4: no wide angle camera, no quad hd display on the small device, outdated hardware, ugly design, an incomplete os, removal of full res photo backups, no fingerprint scanner, dim display) that I'm now eyeing and Asus/Oneplus for my next device. 

By now I expected Google to get it's hardware act together, but it seems like they're gonna stick with the approach of throwing in a good camera and cheapening out on the hardware, expecting their brand name and software gimmicks to justify the price. 

They want to beat Apple at Apple's game, but their OS being an open source software actually denies them that kind of control or loyalty. Hell, even Apple's trying to get it's shit back together by making its OS better and planning a switch to Usb C, Google needs to do better."

You would think it's a horrible phone if you read all the reviews and it's just not the case. The actual case is it's just not enough of an upgrade for some people to upgrade coming from a device in the last two years to justify the cost. We are no longer in the age of substantial upgrades between each release because CPU's and cameras have been good enough for most people the last couple years so it's hard to justify flagship prices at launch.

I get that they're pushing their advanced face scanning biometric security, which is perfectly fine. I use face unlock on my OP most of the time.

I stopped liking several reviewers on youtube when they started overlooking the flaws on previous pixel devices and then praising them and suggesting that they are superior to the competition.

Pixels have had simplistic software and great camera, but they have never been flagship material.
It's the ass-kissing from reviewers during those previous years that allowed Google to pull shit like the Pixel4 this year."
3848,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",Silencer87,9896,2019-11-17 18:52:27,"My opinion after reading the review (which read more like a rant) is that he didn't really go in with an open mind.  He rails against Face ID, but doesn't talk about the disadvantages of the fingerprint sensor.  You can't use it with gloves and it can be problematic when your hands are wet or sweaty.  Also, if the sensor is on the back, you have to lift it to unlock.  It's not perfect, but Face ID should be?

While Motion Sense doesn't have much application currently, it's possible that they want to roll out the gestures slowly.  If they made 5 gestures available at launch, it might be difficult for the average user to learn and remember them all.  

This review did not strike me as objective, but maybe that isn't his goal.  Maybe Ron's goal is to have Ars as his platform to complain about phones so eventually a bezel-less phone will be made to his liking.

To be clear, this is coming from someone who owns a Pixel 2 and is probably going to buy the 4 if it's $200 off.  Would I like more battery life? Of course.  But for $600, it's the right size phone and close to the right price."

It's a great phone and the only complaint I really have is with Android auto (carplay on 6s was way better than AA on the pixel 2/3), but I just use Bluetooth now so it's a moot point. The camera on the 2/3 has been phenomenal compared to the iPhone X (esp. night sight), but I don't know how it stands up to the Xs or the 11. I'd buy the 3xl again in a heartbeat.

3986,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",sixgunmaniac,9896,2019-11-17 16:24:17,"Current phone batteries are designed to hold their charge for 2-3 years regardless of how often you charge it. As long as you aren't often completely discharging before recharging, it won't have any noticable degradation by the end of the second year. However, they all start to degrade at around the same rate into the third year. Properly charging your battery extends its life onto years 3+ but will still have noticable degradation regardless of the phone and charging habits."

If you really want something that'll have great battery life even after two years of heavy usage, I'd look into like a Note 10+, S10+ or something with at least 3800mAh.

I personally use a BlackBerry KEY2 with 3500mAh but since the display is a modest 4.5"" LCD, the battery life is already above average so after a while it may just drop to ""average""."

Generally after incentives I trade or sell my flagship every year. Usually it's $250-400 to upgrade. That sucks but at over $1000 for a new flagship if I wait 3 years is going to cost $800-900 to upgrade and that's basically $300 a year.

But as Android starts to make worse and worse UI/UX decisions every year, I start to question how much I really want ""pure Android"". And at the same time, Samsung's gotten so much better with their UX. 

Installing a custom launcher really _does_ make the OS tolerable in the most recent builds, IMO. And there are things like Good Lock that give you more customizability than Pixel ROMs have. It's rivaled only by the customization options in something like LineageOS.

If the Pixel 3a didn't come out at the price point that it did, and if I weren't against spending over $500 for a phone that I still use for the same things as I used my $350 Nexus 5 for back in 2014, I would have bought a Galaxy S10e for sure. The Pixel value-proposition simply doesn't exist."

Also more convenient in many situations because I can grab the phone however I want, don't need to have my finger on the sensor.

However, the one situation where it literally never works is when the sun is shining directly in front of me, I suppose the IR (or otherwise) light from the sun is too intense relative to their filters and IR projector.

They do have other valid points, and I agree regarding motion sense feeling like it has little place or purpose and wasn't really thought out, and the display brightness and 90hz implementation feel lazy and battery life is lackluster.

I don't really care one way or another to be honest because I enjoy trying out new phones.  One place where the pixel 4 seems to diverge from all the other pixels I got at launch is that I haven't run into the quality control issues that I encountered on literally every other year of pixels.  It's very stable.  As such I don't get the feel of buyers remorse from previous years.  That being said, I wouldn't say it's reason for anyone else to get one as there are still glaring deficiencies with the pixel 4, and I'm not advocating it as a phone suggestion to friends and family members.

>No idea why they weren't more popular...

Marketing. The company simply didn't have the budget to force their phones upon people at the time the smartphone market was rapidly expanding. Whereas Samsung, a significantly larger company with tons of capital, didn't a lot of money on broad scale advertisements to push their phones, and also bought the attention of people in cell phone stores at ATT and Verizon. Back when the s2, s3, etc were coming out, if you walked into a provider store to get a phone, you had two options in the eyes of most salespeople: iPhone or Samsung. Samsung was also very keen on offering a wide range of phones at different price points in the market, and thus selling volume and making lots of money. 

Back in the day, the HTC One/X, M7, and even M8 were largely reviewed as being as good or better than any Android phone available, and rightfully so. But no one knew about them or the company. And then they murdered themselves by sticking to what made these phones so great via the m9, 10, u11+, but it was a stale offering in a lot of peoples' eyes and still a largely unknown quantity beyond techies and industry folks. 

Your parents or aunt or tech-agnistic spouse would never have walked into ATT or Sprint just looking for a decent phone to get them by and walked out with an HTC. They were walking out with a Samsung or an iPhone.

Windows tried to but their way in via marketing and sales incentives with the providers, but it was too little too late despite also making pretty solid phones at the time, all things considered."

It's consistent, reliable, and I'm not a particularly ""power"" user so all of it is fine for me. I only (actively) use my phone for an hour a day, I don't do a ton of GPS stuff, I like the tight Google integration. There are also no other phones with the smaller form factor I enjoy except the S10e, which I will not buy. Does it disappoint me that there is no more unlimited storage on Photos? Sure, but when I actually calculated how many photos I took over three years (including three international trips), it was only about ~50GB, which I don't mind paying for at 1.99/mo. In 2 years paying for that extra storage, I might only pay $40 for cloud storage, and that's given that I'm taking photos literally all the time. I can afford the Pixel, I enjoy the camera immensely (I'm a photographer and I don't regret leaving my gear at home in lieu of my phone), and the $200 ""premium"" really doesn't matter to me because I have everything I need in this phone; I don't feel that I'm really compromising on multiple things."

What does the OP7T offer over the Pixel 4? Better price, sure. Better battery life (though the difference on the 7T and 4XL are not huge, and if you are using the giant 7T screen, you'd probably use the larger XL.  Ok. 

Camera? 7T has an ultra wide, but overall camera quality is a notable step down. 

Software? Could consider a wash, but as a 3x OnePlus owner (and I still own a 6), I prefer the Pixel's software, especially the AOD, Now Playing, Squeeze for Assistant, call screening, etc. 

Pixel has wireless charging, which the OP phones lack. Both have good 90Hz screens. Pixel's is more accurate. OnePlus's is brighter. 

Updates? OnePlus is better than most, but still nowhere near Google in that department. 

Pixel 4 is IP68 if you care about a rating (though I personally don't...OnePlus has shown their weathersealing is good.). 

Is the 7T a better value? Definitely. Is it a better phone? Definitely debatable.  

And for my take: I'm sick of big phones. My OnePlus 6 became annoying over time due to its size, and the newer OP devices are all even bigger. For me, my options on the Android side for a smaller phone are basically Pixel 4 vs S10e. Everything else is big. And I'm not a big fan of Samsung devices. There's just something about the experience that rubs me the wrong way. 

Fwiw, I have loved my Pixel 4 in the 4 weeks I've had it. It's been a fantastic device, and I far prefer it to my OnePlus 6. And I really like the OP6."

Lack of fisheye lens that is of low quality anyway. 

Slightly worse battery that's not going to make a difference to anyone (9 hours SOT Vs 7)

It's downsides aren't really that big. Ultra wide cams are low quality. Battery life isn't going to affect anyone since it comfortably lasts the entire day on heavy use. If max brightness can still hurt your eyes indoors at 1pm then the phone is bright enough."

It's more than good enough to fit everything in the frame. That's a similar angle to the Pixel 4 default camera btw. You don't need any wider. 

Ultra wide is actually another term for fisheye lens. Everything from a lens like this will look distorted. It's a very specific visual effect that is good for certain things. It's not capturing more in the frame it's squeezing it into a frame. It rarely looks good. Not to mention the fisheye lens that is on note 10 and iPhone are using a 1/3.5 inch sensor. Photos taken on these are full of noise and dark compared to the normal wide lens. Google was right saying the super zoom is far more useful than this lens. 

They aren't good features. It's a gimmick and anyone who cares about image quality won't use it often. It's just a nice to have feature that has been thrown in.

The ultra wide (fisheye) lens isn't used often in photography as it distorts the image so much. It's always been a gimmick.

The fisheye lens used in iPhone and Samsung are 1/3.5"" sensors. They are a lot smaller than main sensor and so look dark and grainy next to the normal wide lens.

Any ""competent"" photographer would choose to position themself with a high quality prime lens to get the best possible image rather than forcing everything in the shot with bad quality and distorted horizontal lines. 

Any ""competent"" photographer would use the best image quality and let the shot speak for itself. The telephoto with high quality zoom is far more important than sticking a cheap gimmick lens onto the camera setup.

Editing the homescreen is a task, and no option to sort by alphabetically unless you reset your homescreen which deletes all the folders you made.  No optionto sort apps within folders either, so everything seems unorganized to me.  With jailbreak I think there are tools to fix all that and to add a scrolling dock to add folders or app.

A lot of what Apple does is only possible because of the numbers they produce. This especially concerns vertical integration. Google would‘ve long designed their own SoC‘s. But the economies of scale are just not there. Samsung did it and they don‘t even come close to Apple‘s chip.

In India, as per pixel's support team they only have 1 repair center, in Mumbai. So if someone in some other part of the country has a problem with their phone then google would send phone to mumbai to repair. Not only that, their customer support chat is quite bad. 

Their online support is pretty bad. In some cities google offers pick up by their own staff who would provide you with a spare phone, on other locations it would be some courier service they would book, so no spare phone. Not that bad of a policy but then there is no list, either public or with customer care about where this pick up service is available, you have to give customer care guy pin code, they would check if its available and then ask for another pincode.

Google News recently removed the ability to search by date, which makes it about as useful as searching for news on Twitter. You can still search by date on normal Google.com and clocking the *News* category (I assume this is inadvertant and will be removed in the future).

Speaking of categories, they went from being predictable to literally randomly sorted a few years ago. Is the second button *Images? News? Shopping? Maps?* Who the hell knows.

Just the other day I noticed that dates were removed from search results on the Desktop, so I couldn't tell which Stack Exchange threads for an Android problem I was Googling were from Ice Cream Sandwich vs. Android 10.

And on top of all of this, I feel like the results just get less and less relevant every year."

We're only talking about a small sample size of products you know. Pixel 1 and 2 were good products, for their value and overall experience, at a time when Samsung and other manufacturers skinned versions of Android were still apparent and definitely not nearly as polished. Pixel 3 was just ""okay"", definitely a great phone if bought on the cheap but retailed far too high for my liking and then the pixel 4 is just a laughing stock compared to what is on the market and even as a pure android lover, what Samsung is offering has surpassed pure android in multiple respects, at least in my eyes. The only thing that Google has over the competition is timely updates which at this point, I'd rather run a stable version than test shit for Google and their unnecessary push to ""upgrade"" their service.

It mainly looks distorted only around the edges and if the subject is too close. If you use it properly and in the right situations it is an amazing tool.

Scenery and nature photos is where the ultrawide excels in, as it takes much more in without that much distortion.

Also for photos where you want to take a picture of a person with a lot of the background. If you move too far back the subject becomes too small, an ultrawide lets you stay closer to the subject while taking the entire scenery. For example a person sitting on a rock, you cannot move back to get the whole scenery and then tell the person to move closer to the camera because the rock is in a fixed position. 

Another advantage is in areas where you do not have room to move back. An ultrawide can let you take in the whole picture when you don't have room to move back.

Finally skyscrapers, if trying to take a vertical picture of a skyscraper close to the base of it you cannot fit the whole skyscraper unless you have an ultra wide. Same with mountains or cliff faces.

I was recently in Iceland for a month, and the ultrawide was so useful (iPhone 11 pro). It took so many amazing photos that wouldn't have been possible without it.

Yes, your normal wide angle lens will still be taking the majority of your photos but between ultrawide and telephoto, the ultrawide is infinitely more useful.

Just admit Google made a mistake, they should have gone with 3 lenses, considering the ultra premium price it comes with. But if they had to choose only 2, the ultrawide by far is the correct decision."

Camera.  Now I am hardly a photographer, so it could have been my ignorance of settings.  But...the Pixel blows the S10 away camera wise in simple point and shoot.  It's not even remotely close.  But it may have been I did not know how to tweak the S10 camera.

But the common wisdom is true too.  The S10 battery was better than my Pixel.  It's a trade-off.  I will say the difference in camera between the two is larger than the difference in battery if that makes sense."

Battery Life:

Pixel can get over 7 hours SOT at 200 nits of brightness. iPhone pro max can get over 11. Note 10+ is around 9 hours 30. What advantage are you getting exactly from this extra battery life? It means you can skip charging one night and have a couple of left over hours of SOT the next day. If you don't plan your day well then having 15 hours SOT can put you in just as much risk as 7 hours SOT. Most people will charge their phone every night anyway regardless of battery size. 7 hours is MORE than enough. If it isn't then its a special case and you'll likely be carrying a charger around anyway if you use your phone that much between charges.

Brightness:

Indoors if you turn the brightness to the max on pixel non-stop it will hurt your eyes. Most people are around 200-300 nits tops indoors and even lower at night. What do you need the extra brightness for? Sunlight. I'm coming from a note 9 which can go to nearly 700 nits in peak brightness when in sunlight. You still can't see the phone screen well in those conditions, you can't see 1000 nit TVs well in those conditions. They aren't designed to be perfect in those conditions. With the Pixel 4 you can easily see everything on the screen at its max 444 nits. And that's enough. It just has to be well enough to function then you can enjoy your screen quality outside of direct sunlight 99.9% of the time. Total non-issue.

Speakers:

Not even gunna elaborate on this it's ridiculous you even brought it up. 

Camera:

 iPhone 11 pro has an amazing camera for a smartphone and in good outdoor lighting its very hard to tell the difference unless you zoom into the shot. It's portrait mode is bad, even in the youtube and blog comparisons after the phone released there's noticeable mistakes in the edge detection in almost every shot and the blur doesn't look real, yet Pixel is getting it almost perfect almost every time with extra depth in the blur and edge detection. Nightmode has more noise and a weird yellow tinge to every shot yet the pixel preserves unreal detail and HDR. White balance and HDR in general is where the pixel is still lightyears ahead of apple and in certain conditions its dramatic. front camera also has all the pixel magic whereas apple's cant do night mode. 

Oneplus and note 10. These are so fucking far behind Pixel and iphone you should be embarassed you even mentioned then as being close in quality. 

Have-another-look ;)"

Yes, every other year they change one or two things about the EXTERNAL design. But what you don’t see in advertising or videos is what’s being improved  INTERNALLY. And these internal improvements most certainly are not cookie cutter by any means.

Every year, at least that’s the case in recent years, most of the upgrades are internal upgrades. Things like battery improvements, OS improvements, SoC improvements (A13 chip and the neural engine), Face ID improvements, better IP/water resistant rating, increased RAM, etc. None of these are visible on the outside, but that doesn’t mean that nothing has changed.

That said, I can understand how, if you just simply looked at the iPhone X, Xs, and 11 side by side without knowing anything about the internal hardware, you can definitely say that they are “cookie cutter”. But what you don’t see is the number of improvements on the inside that make the device, especially the SoC (the A13 chip), years ahead of the ones in flagship Android devices."

To be honest, many of the Samsung apps are a lot better than any alternatives I could find as well. Such as the E-Mail app, the Calendar or the Clock app for alarms and timers and most importantly, the Internet Browser. Faster than Chrome, with built in ad block (and allowing you to use third party ad blockers as well) and a so much better layout that doesn't force you to touch the top of your screen.

One UI being vastly superior to the stock android launcher isn't really my opinion though, but largely a consensus between reviewers. It allows for greater customization and has a more natural layout."

>It seems they really started to lose their market share when the S3 came out... it's like once HTC phones started becoming good (aluminum build quality, etc), Samsung took over.

Right, that was the whole point of my prior comment. HTC had some decent phones early int he game, but around d the time Samsung started to pick things up with the s3, they really started to push market share through extensive investment in advertising and pushing a confusingly large amount of phones to gain market share. It's simple: flood the market when everyone is rushing to it, and then slowly reduce options over time once you've had people hooked into your brand. Outside of niche users like often found on Reddit, most people just keep in their same technology lane and will be pretty likely just get the newest version of the same device. Apple has been riding this for years. Anyway, yeah, Samsung bought market share, largely, as they were making pretty average devices for many, many years, really up until the S6/S7. All of HTC's impacts were, as we've both noted, prior to the massive smartphone market expansion 5-7 years ago."

Only thing that comes close is the iPhone to the Pixel quality and it's ultra wide isn't great. And I'd rather have 90hz and android Vs iOS.

I almost feel like that was a point in making waterproof phones: to prevent people from easily opening them, thus being able to tell if the phone was opened by someone outside of the company. 

But idk, I'm just conspiracizing here."

* Smoother experience day to day.  I mean it's a new phone with double the ram so duh, but we'll see how long it lasts. One thing the pixel was great at was staying relatively smooth for a long ass time. 

* Battery life.  On the snapdragon variant I'm getting double the SOT I was getting on my pixel. there hasn't been a day yet I have gotten less than 6 hours SOT and most I get 7-9. 

* I remapped the bixby button (bxactions) and now have a multifunction button to launch flashlight, SoundHound, onehanded mode. 

* One UI is solid. No real major complaints about it. 

* Smart switch carried over a bit more data than I thought. There were some apps that had the right settings and we're logged in.  

* FP scanner is fucking fast. Like stupid fast. 

Cons:

* This may just be me, but I fucking hate the volume rocker placement. Jesus Christ Samsung. You have the whole right side or anywhere below the bixby button. 

* After a month the aspect ratio is still throwing me. Mostly when I type or reach for the nav bar (which is ALL the way at the bottom of the phone). 

* FP scanner is on the power button. I'm adapting, but back is still my preferred location. 

* No full res photo backup.

I like the phone. If it holds up lag free and the SOT doesn't take a nosedive for 2+ years (I'm willing to change the battery, I'm talking software) then I'll be totally happy."

I’ll start by saying every phone I’ve owned, I’ve had for at least two years. Which really isn’t that long. 

When I had my htc one m7 one of the speakers blew. Probably my fault? It went bad at around the two year mark. But I was with Sprint and there’s no htc store so I had to get it replaced with a refurbished unit. That unit had slight separation near the top of the display and speaker grill and the sim tray was slightly askew. Had to wait about a week to get it. 

My galaxy s6 at the two year mark (I had one payment left) started to drop battery percentage like crazy, die at around 40% battery, I had to again send it out through Sprint to Asurion. No loaner phone so I had to activate my old refurbished htc to use. A week goes by and I get the phone back. Get it activated again, walk out the store and boom it dies on me again. Sprint said they have no repair notes but the repair facility said they fixed everything. Left them my phone again to send back out. I talked to asurion directly and they were going to overnight me a phone but it was Friday night and they had to send it to the store I sent my phone out from. Monday rolls around and I get a call from the Sprint store saying they never sent my phone out because it would probably come back with the same issue again. Like what the fuck!? 5 minutes later they call back and say uhhh we have a replacement phone here for you. That replacement had no issues luckily and my dad used it for about another 2 years. 

My galaxy s8 had a spec of dust under the front camera. Luckily I was under Samsung’s warranty for that but I still had to send the phone out to Samsung’s repair center in Texas I think. That was a 3 day turn around time and again I activated an old phone to use. 

None of these were my fault. Shit fails. These things are on 24/7 going through bumps and bruises from daily use. Hot and cold weather. But if any of these companies had a store front I could have got these squared away in a couple hours to maybe a day. 

If they were anything like the Apple store I could have got a remanufactured device same day, a battery or a screen replacement in an hour or two, a new speaker in the same time frame. 

You should not have to go in multiple times to get stuff fixed but knowing you can make an appointment and get shit done same day is a benefit of getting an Apple device. Now that you can extend Apple Care plus to for the life of the device it’s also nice to know you’re covered for defects for a fairly decent monthly price. You’ll also probably spend more on insurance than needed but by chance (knock on wood I’ve never broke a device) I drop it and shatter it I can have a replacement with all Apple parts for $99. 

Not an Apple shill. I’ve owned android exclusively until the 11 pro. Yes I kind of miss my S9 on the daily but for now it just works and I have no issues with it."

You can use different browsers from Firefox to Chrome and just about everything else. You just can’t set them to be the default, which in all honesty isn’t that big of a deal because every time you want to open a link, it will ask you if you want to open it in Safari or in another browser you have. 

You can change the stock keyboard to any keyboard available on the App Store. I used GBoard because it had Swipe typing, but I switched back to the default keyboard after it got swipe typing in iOS 13.

The only features I miss about Android is the notifications and Google Assistant. That’s about it.

A lot of people complain about the lack of customization, but that really doesn’t bother me that much. On the home screen, I always kept my apps in home screen folders anyway. That’s why I don’t miss the app drawer since I kept all of my apps on the home screen. I don’t care about changing launchers and whatnot, since I like the default look of iOS best. Obviously if you like to change around the look of your phone, you’ll be disappointed in iOS. But for me, it doesn’t bother me at all. 

What surprised me was just how smooth and natural everything feels, from the UI to the UX. One of the most underrated features of iOS is the consistency. I know it’s cliche, but it really does just work. There is a consistent design language throughout the entire UI and across all default apps and most third party apps. This is such an underrated feature because each app feels like it was built for a singular purpose. Each app feels like they were made in cooperation with each other, unlike Google who seems to have like 3 different apps for the same purpose. With a consistent UI, moving between apps is natural and more aesthetically pleasing to look at compared to the mess that is Android’s general design language. Moving between apps is predictable because you know where to find certain functions of an app and what the app should look like.

The gesture navigation is by far one of my favorite features of iOS. It works much better than the gesture navigation you find on Android devices. It is also a much more natural and smoother way to navigate the UI compared to buttons. One example is when using the home swipe gesture, you can flick the app from the bottom of the screen back to the home page. With the physics engine of iOS, the harder you flick, the harder the app gets thrown back to the home screen. It’s simple and a small thing, but it just feels so natural to use. It’s hard to describe through words, but once you actually use and experience it in person, it’s a game changer. 

Let me know if you have any more questions."

Things I don't miss:

3. Security updates that break things that take months to fix. 
4. Having less control over what 3rd party apps have access to on my phone

Yes you can. The only time you can’t is when you’re typing in a password text box. Which I mean is a good thing because you don’t want third party keyboards stealing your passwords right? I used GBoard for a year because the default iOS keyboard didn’t have swipe type. Not once did it change on me unless I was typing in a password.

> Google Photos can't upload in the background.

Depends on what you mean by “background”. Google Photos can upload photos in the background as long as I have the app running and it’s in my app switcher. But it won’t automatically upload unless I open the app first. After I open the app, I can leave it in the background and go to another app while it uploads my photos.

I personally think that Google services work better on iOS than they do on Android. The G apps on iOS feel much smoother and overall better made than their Android equivalents. But that’s my personal opinion"

Oh wait, sounds exactly like midrange phone. Or the great camera? Yeah, you're right, that's where the pixel is still better than midrange phones, but then again it's missing a 60 fps option at 4k, rendering 4k useless. You can straight up get $350-$400 mid range phones with better hardware than the Pixel, that's literally a fact, just look at Xiaomi or Oppo. Snap 855, 8gb ram, 64mp camera, 4k 60fps video, wide lens and a 4000mah battery at $350.

Their support doesn't matter here whatsoever either, because phone support will always come from the reseller and not the manufacturer.

What you're sacrificing is a tiny bit of camera quality, a half broken 90hz display and the brand name. What you gain is $400 and a much better battery. It is a phone with a great experience, out of the box, just cheaper.

If you purchased one knowing that it didn't have a fingerprint reader and then one of your criticisms is that it doesn't have one, it's on you cause they told you that, it's not something to be tested like you can quality or speed of a fingerprint reader. Same with a notification light, you get test if you like how bright it is or whatever, but buying one and then criticizing it for not having the light isn't a fair criticism cause that was well-known going into your purchase.

Yeah they barely changed anything at all, if you look only externally.

Just because you can’t actually see the improvements or changes doesn’t mean that they are “cookie cutter” by any means.

The iPhone X was the first iPhone to have a major external design change since the original iPhone. Some people didn’t and still don’t like this change because it changed the way you interacted with the device using gestures instead of a button."

I do change phones every two years, and I’ve never had any battery issues despite only doing the bare minimum.

Airpods in the other hand are dead already. I do take a lot better care of my second pair of wireless headphones because the battery degraded really fast. I’m only getting about 30 minutes of talk time in my OG airpods bought on launch day."

Just focus on avoiding a fully discharged battery and your phone's battery should last for multiple years.

Chase/ADT still doesn't have support though, just checked as I figured maybe they updated their apps as well. 

I'm not sure why that's a weird question - I get 4 hours SOT other people have responded to me claiming they get 8 hours. So if you're a 8 hour person saying it's ""fine"" it's a lot different than if you're a 4 hour person saying it's ""fine"" - it's cool that you're not inconvenienced by the battery life but that doesn't really tell me anything without specifying what you consider an inconvenience. 

I'll run my battery out tomorrow and take a screenshot when it's low and report back here. I've already investigated this though, there really are no rogue apps sucking battery - yeah chase and stuff accesses location but battery stats are reporting it at like 1-2% usage at most. Either way I linked a GSM arena review in another post that showed the Pixel 4XL getting significantly worse battery than the O7T despite having nearly identical battery sizes and that's with the 4XL running adaptive 90hz and the O7T running forced 90. Anandtech also has the 4XL lower than most phones despite having a larger size battery than them. Either way the battery is fine for me but that's only the case when I turn smooth display off. With it on I don't even hit 4 hours SOT - it performs worse than my 2XL."

This can indeed be a factor, but a very subjective one. I do like ""stock"" Android (Pixel Android is far from being stock) but the last couple of years' updates have been very, *very* incremental, and basically brought back to ""Stock"" features that were already existent in one way or another from many OEMs.

> The Camera as well.

This I agree, but to a point - let's be perfectly honest, in 99% of cases, most flagships from the last 2-3 years are perfectly capable when it comes to photography, and most of the differences lie in color accuracy and software postprocessing. The Pixels have great cameras, but not *that* better that it'd be a deal-breaker for the majority of people.

> I also like that they make smaller screen phones.

Physical footprint is arguably more impactful than screen size when it comes to daily use. I'm also [not sure what you mean](https://phonesized.com/compare/#1235,1109,1330,1182,1180) by that, Pixels aren't particularly small devices, I'd even say pretty damn average.

All of this combined with trade-offs like the lackluster battery size, an unfortunately timed release cycle meaning the chips are considered ""previous gen"" a month or two after they come out... It doesn't make me feel like the Pixels are front-runners in anything but how expensive they are for what you get - to my great despair.

At the price these phones are, I don't feel like compromising is something I should be doing as a customer."

The S10 has a horrible camera compared to Pixel and iPhone. Overall image quality with an already wide lens is far more important than the fisheye effect feature.

You zoom for landscapes when there's things blocking the shot such as crowds of people, edges of buildings, towns in the distance. There isn't a one size fits all for lenses."

5211,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",123td1234,9896,2019-11-18 06:50:59,"> I see the difference in notifications mentioned a bit. What exactly is the difference? It's hard to find.

Well for me the biggest differences between iOS and Android notifications are: the way the notifications are grouped and how to manage the notifications. 

The way the notifications are grouped: On Android, all of the notifications can be grouped in several ways. For example, for a messaging app, the notifications can be grouped by message thread. In one single notification banner, you can have several lines of separate messages, if that makes sense. Each message in the same thread is combined and makes up a singular notification banner, so it’s clean and easy to manage. You can have multiple notification banners for different threads, but for the same thread, you’ll have just one banner regardless of how many messages you receive. 

On iOS though, each individual message regardless of whether it’s in the same thread or not, is separated into a separate banner. Each individual message has its own notification banner. So if you get multiple messages from a message thread, you will have a ton of notification banners, and you have to scroll through each one individually. It’s just a mess. So if you’re in a group chat that’s blowing up, it’s very possible that you can end up with over like a hundred Messages notifications that you scroll through in your Notification Center. It’s a mess.

While you can group them all, it isn’t the same grouping system. iOS grouping of notifications is merely just stacking the banners on top of each other. When you “expand” this stack, you’ll get the same ridiculously unnecessary list of abundant notifications, when you can just combine them all into one neat banner like on Android. Not sure if I explained that well, so let me know if you need me to explain it more.

Managing notifications: to dismiss a notification in the Notification Center on Android, you just swipe it away. One swipe dismisses the notification. A swipe in the other direction gives you access to the notification controls. It’s fast and easy. If you get a notification banner while dong something and want to dismiss it, you just swipe to the side to dismiss it. 

On iOS though, to dismiss a notification in the NC, you have to swipe to the left once, revealing 3 options: Clear, View, or Manage. And then you have to either press clear or swipe left AGAIN to dismiss the banner. It’s a two step process that should only ever take one. I think it’s extremely inefficient and annoying.

Also, when you get a notification banner while doing something, you can’t swipe it away to dismiss it like you can on Android. You have to swipe down or long press on the banner first, to view the notification. And then in order to dismiss it, you have to swipe down. Idk if it’s an iOS bug or something, but this often rarely works to dismiss a notification. I always just end up just swiping the banner up (which sends it to the NC), and then dismissing it from there. It’s annoying and inefficient. 

> Also there's mention of background app use being limited. In what way? At the moment I like being able to flick between 2-3 apps at once. I assume that's not an issue on ios.

This really is not an issue anymore. iOS may have less RAM than most Android devices nowadays, but it doesn’t really matter because the iPhone makes up for this lack of RAM with its optimization between hardware and software. iOS is typically very smart in managing RAM so don’t worry about lower specs on paper.  You can most certainly switch between apps and the apps will stay in memory. 

I think what you’ve been hearing about is certain cases when apps pause while you switch to another app. This is actually true in some cases. This happens especially when downloading something in an app, like in games. When you need to download like a game patch or something, you have to have the app open and active otherwise the app won’t download the patch. Idk why it does this and it is annoying. But it doesn’t happen to every app. Like I can pause what I’m typing here right now, go to YouTube to watch a video, go to Safari to look something up, and then come back to this comment that I’m typing and everything will be where I left it. In most cases, it’s not that big of a deal honestly. You can flick though multiple apps just fine; iOS manages apps a lot better than Android does.

> Could I have a homescreen of 4 apps and then the next screen include all the other apps I use less frequently?

Yes. [I did it here on my home screen.](https://imgur.com/a/rvCG3ts). However, you just can’t organize the apps in a free grid or have the apps toward the bottom like you can on Android. Your apps are listed from top to bottom. I personally don’t mind this as I think it looks better this way. But I can totally see how others may not like it especially those with smaller hands and don’t want to have to reach the top of the screen to get to an app. I personally don’t mind it though. 

Let me know if you have any more questions. I’m more than happy to answer them. To be honest, a lot of these issues you kind of just learn to live with eventually. To me, these cons aren’t deal breakers. I use iPhone because I think its pros heavily outweigh its cons. Hope I didn’t scare you away though!"

“While the iPhone 7 touts Apple's 64-bit Fusion A10 chip, the iPhone 8 features Apple's new A11 Bionic CPU, coming paired with an Apple-built GPU. This six-core CPU is divided into two low-performance cores and four high-performance cores, with the regular cores being 25 per cent faster than the previous A10 chip, and the high-performance cores being up to 75 per cent faster than the A10 SoC.”

So between the 7 and the 8, there  are *slight* improvements in chip performance (25 percent and 75 percent), but they are still improvements nonetheless. Whether this “slight” performance boost is “significant” enough for an upgrade is subjective.

There are improvements not only on speed and power, but also efficiency as well due to specialized cores on the chip, which results in better battery life. And these newer chips enable things like better AR and less bottlenecking which can be a significant upgrade for some. Some people only want the most powerful chipset available, and so this will be a “significant” upgrade for them and they will always want to upgrade.

What the specs sheets don’t show is how much smarter, more efficient, and more battery saving the new chips are compared to an older one.

Also, as I said before, the internal changes aren’t just performance (the chip). It’s things like an increased water resistance, which is always welcome. It’s things like the battery as well. The iPhone 11/Pro battery is the number one thing that users and reviewers rave about. If you really care about battery life, then it would be a significant upgrade and change for you, since you get upwards of 5 more hours of battery life than the previous generation. 5 extra hours of battery life isn’t a “slight” change my any means."

A couple years ago I was at a wedding reception for a coworker friend of mine that took place in a hotel. The photographer was taking pictures of the new couple with their friends and family, and there was a beautiful Christmas tree in the lobby, like 11/10, that everyone wanted to stand in front of. But there was a TV nearby that was playing CNN, and the light coming from it was ruining the photos.

The girl at the reception  desk had no idea where the remote for it was, to turn it off, and it was mounted high enough that no one could reach the controls. Everyone was bummed because they wouldn't  be able to get these photos, and then I whip out my G4, and say ""Hold on everyone, I got this"" Took me all of 6 seconds to fire up the remote app, find the right IR setting, and turn off the TV.

Everyone cheered.

As it was a coworker's wedding, my boss was also there with his wife, and was quite impressed by my resourcefulness. He started paying more attention to my efforts at work, and I ended up getting a raise and a promotion some months later."

Before that I had the LG HBS-760, these are great wear all day long headphones.  My user-case was working at an overnight warehouse type job and would put them in when starting work in an area.  During the day my use was to have them around neck, and if I happened to watch video or something on phone, they were already paired and I could just pop in headphone to listen, instead of having to deal with phone speakers.  These were great headphones with \~10 hours of battery life with constant use.

I don't have that type of user-case now and just use airpods/QC-35.  This combo is perfect for me at this time, but I can understand that being a little rich for some peoples taste.

Also if you are looking for some weird form factor headphones, I have briefly used the Aftershokz Titanium, which are bone conduction headphones, and the Bose frames, which are sunglasses with speakers on them.

> While you can group them all, it isn’t the same grouping system. iOS grouping of notifications is merely just stacking the banners on top of each other. When you “expand” this stack, you’ll get the same ridiculously unnecessary list of abundant notifications, when you can just combine them all into one neat banner like on Android. Not sure if I explained that well, so let me know if you need me to explain it more.

Is this an option in settings. To group or ungroup? I don't mind the sound of how they group them. I'm imagining I might see a notification that Signal messages, some emails and a phone call are waiting though I won't know from who unless I click on the app grouping. Is that right?

Googles phones have been trying to be iPhones so much lately, and they just cant because their software optimization is nowhere near as good as Apple's. 

But yeah the original pixel and pixel 2 were great, because they had amazing camera performance along with adequacy in everything else. The philosophy for the Pixel 4 seems to have been, ""how much subpar hardware can we fit in the phone, while still maintaining the guise that we make up for it with optimization?"" 

Look, for an $800 phone, there's no reason to not have 8-12 gigs of RAM, and at least a 4000mAh battery. The only reason Apple can get away with the less specs is because they actually come through with optimization. They don't NEED 12 gigs of RAM because their RAM management on iOS is so good. They don't NEED huge battery sizes because they don't allow background apps to drain the battery like Android does. 8 gigs of RAM is overkill on an iPhone, but definitely not on Android. I have 8GB RAM (I believe) on my Note 9, and that's been adequate, with certain apps not even being able to stay open for too long.

How so? Are you using the latest iOS 13? Because they revamped the whole Share sheet in iOS 13 and it’s much much cleaner and streamlined than it was on previous iOS.

>Worse notifications

Absolutely agree. Notifications are terrible on iOS compared to Android. 

>NO BACK BUTTON

You don’t necessarily need a back button because you can swipe right from the edge of the screen to go back. Or in most apps, you can swipe right from any part of the screen to go back. You don’t have to reach for the edge of the screen. You can swipe from the middle. Although I can see how it may be an issue for those with bigger phones or smaller hands and can’t reach the edge of the screen with one hand to swipe back. 


>the home screen is a lot worse on iOS, though that's related to their customization issues

Depends on your use case. Some people like me don’t care about customization. I actually like the default look of the iOS launcher, so I don’t care for customization. But this one is largely preference based. If you like to customize your home screen, go Android. Otherwise iOS is fine. I personally like the look of the apps at the top of the home screen grid than at the bottom, although I can see how people would rather have their apps on the bottom of the grid for easier access.

> Is this an option in settings. To group or ungroup? I don't mind the sound of how they group them. I'm imagining I might see a notification that Signal messages, some emails and a phone call are waiting though I won't know from who unless I click on the app grouping. Is that right?

Yeah there is an option to group or ungroup notifications in settings. And yes your other question is correct. Except for the top level notification, you would have to click on the app grouping to know which messages or notifications are from who. That’s why Android in this case is better in my opinion. You don’t need to click on the app grouping to see your messages, since it’s grouped into one single individual notification banner. 

[Here’s](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/customize-group-notifications-ios-12/amp/) some information about grouped notifications that should answer your questions. Sorry, it’s just hard to explain what I’m trying to say without actually showing it to you if that makes sense. Hopefully this website can explain it a lot better than I can lol

[The official Apple support website also should help.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201925) it has some basic information in notifications and how to customize them. 

> Is this true if you use the ungrouped or grouped option as well?

You only need to swipe down to dismiss a notification if you get it while not inThe NC. So if I’m typing this comment and a notification banner appears, I have to slide down on the banner (which expands the notification) and then I have to swipe down again to dismiss it. Or swipe up on the banner to send it to the Notification Center. Grouped notifications don’t matter if you’re not in NC. You can do it for all notification banners."

I don’t have a link right now, but I’ve read articles and posts before affirming a huge difference in data transmission from iOS and Android devices at “idle” (when no third party apps are active and no non-stock apps and services are running in the background), as well as observations of lower quantities of data transmission in general use. For idle the difference was something like ~150MB a year for iOS vs. multiple gigabytes for Android.

>	That's just corporate agit-prop. They might be marginally better, but fundamentally their subject to the same ROI requirements that Google is. They are no going to miss out on money. Especially when they know that vast majority of people brand-fanboys are not going to be critical about anything.

When you think about it though that’s not the case at all.

Apple is hugely dependent on their hardware sales, and they sell them for a high price because they are focused on maintaining a ~40% or so profit margin. Their services largely exist to boost user satisfaction with and engagement in their ecosystem, incentivising users to remain in the ecosystem and to continue purchasing more devices within it. The majority of Apple’s services are only available on their devices as a result; to maximise device sales and profitability.

Google’s dependent on ad revenue. Their hardware and services exist to extend or improve their ad services; to either expose users to ads, or obtain data from users to improve ads. Their hardware is irrelevant because they’re a small fry in the phone market, have no presence in the general desktop and laptop market, and only have a considerable presence in the education market - where profit largely comes from their services and data tracking, not hardware. 

They are very different companies with very different requirements for user data. Apple still needs to track data to make some things work, but that’s all - Google needs to track data not only to make things work, but also to garner additional context on the user’s purchasing habits, interests, traits and other info to influence ad targeting to that user."

I wonder why iPhone users are more satisfied with their devices compared to Android users. A lot of what you said amounts to “shit talking” iOS. It’s funny that in so many threads about iOS and Android, it’s usually in Android user that chimes in to talk about the faults of iOS. People with iPhones are happy using their phones and aren’t interested in talking shit about Android. The fact that you even used the “iOS have features that android has had for years. Woo.” line is quite telling.

Not everyone is happy with OS fragmentation, slow ass updates (sometimes even complete software abandonment), inconsistent UI/UX, ugly icons, and weak hardware unless it’s a mid- or high-end device from a reputable manufacturer.

You’re obviously not a fan of iOS. I find it amusing that you’ve put in this much effort to talk shit, lmao."

I can make my Android phone look nearly indistinguishable on the home screen to an iOS device, but you cannot do the reverse. The iOS home screen is literally worse or the same in every way.

I mean, if you’re not into customization, then the customization options that you have on Android would be useless to you right? You wouldn’t miss it if you didn’t have it On IOS. To an extent,  it would be nice to have those options, but as I’ll say in the next paragraphs, they aren’t always for everyone.

And it isn’t just about copying how the home screen or how the system looks in general. You can make your Android look exactly like iOS which is cool, but what you cannot copy is things like the physics engine and the smoothness and overall polish of the whole UI. You can copy the look of iOS, but you’ll never be able to copy the best parts about what makes an iPhone an iPhone.

>Willingly giving yourself fewer options is not something I am keen on.

This is also preference. For some people, less really is more. Fewer options is better for them because they don’t have to worry about changing up the look of their phone every other week. They just use the phone and it works for them. When I switched to iOS, it was like a breath of fresh air not having to deal with custom launchers and ROMs. It is understandable though if you want to have options available. Again that’s just preference. 

>FWIW I mostly am familiar with iOS 11 and prior, as I switched to a Note 8 not long after that came out and have been using it ever since.

So you haven’t tried iOS 13? iOS 13 is better than 11 in so many ways, in terms of functionality and overall speed of the device. The new Share sheet in 13 is much better than it was before. I would check that out. It’s much more streamlined and cleaner than before. [This](https://imgur.com/a/KTnEbTS) is what it looks like now. It is much better than it was on iOS 11.

>New updates make iOS have features that android has had for years. Woo.

Yes. And this is one of the biggest reasons why people use Apple products. They get new updates every year for at least 4-5 years. You mentioned you’re on the Note 8. That came out just about 2 years ago. But it’s no longer receiving updates from Samsung right? That’s ridiculous since you dropped upwards of $900 on it right? A 2 year old $900 device should have more support than just a year of support. In comparison, the iPhone 5s which came out in 2013, was able to get updates up until 2018 with iOS 12. That’s 5 years of updates right there.

It’s not about getting features that Android has had for years. I couldn’t care less about which platform has/gets which feature first. But what I care about is long term support and how well the updates and features are implemented and integrated into the existing software. It doesn’t matter to me if you’re first, if the feature, like most Google products, is half assed and looks like it was thrown together without any thought as to what the purpose of the app should be. In comparison, each app on iOS generally has a consistent UI and design language that makes the whole system and UX flow naturally especially when moving across apps. You don’t get this on Android. Just like the home screen, you can copy the way something looks on iOS, but you cannot copy the consistency of the UX and UI. 

>apple has no ""one handed mode"" like Samsung and some others have adopted where you can temporarily shrink your screen to make one handed operation easier.

Yes there is. It’s called Reachability. On devices with a notch, you just swipe down from the bottom of the screen to bring all of the elements at the top of the screen towards the bottom so that you can reach them with one hand. On home button iPhones, you double tap the home button to do the same thing. [It brings all elements of the UI down towards the middle and bottom of the screen for easy one handed use. ](https://imgur.com/a/bSWnddv)"

As I said, one year. They did a test for an hour and from that data extrapolated to determine approximately how much would be transmitted over a year.

As for exactly what’s in the data, that’s not entirely clear - but the quantity of data alone paints an interesting picture of the difference.

>	How can you make all these crazy assumptions when you can't even explain what you are talking about?

Google is *known* to harvest user data extensively, they’ve been not only accused of it but conclusively found to be doing it plenty of times before. It’s their entire business model. Apple are *not* known to harvest user data extensively, and from those tests it seems likely that indeed they are not (otherwise the transmitted data would likely be significantly greater in size).

*You* are the one making assumptions by blithely saying “Apple big evil company, they’re just as bad as Google” without any substance to back it up.

People have observed the data and noticed Apple’s devices “leak” less data at idle than their Android counterparts, ergo they are collecting and transmitting inherently less data to external servers. Given Apple’s business model does *not* revolve around the harvesting of user data (and doing so would make little sense for them as they aren’t in a position to directly profit from it in the same way Google are), it is very *unlikely* that Apple are in any way as invasive of user privacy as Google are.

You call what I and others say “corporate agit-prop”, but I’d have to call what you say “baseless conspiracy theorising”.

First of all I don't buy your whole ""multiple gigs"" story. I have an AndroidOne device and I regularly check my data usage and track DNS requests coming from my phone.

That's not how businesses work. Their required to maximize their ROI on all business lines. That means both hardware and services. If you read their annual report or their quarterly conference calls, they consistently talk about increasing revenue in their service line.

>You call what I and others say “corporate agit-prop”, but I’d have to call what you say “baseless conspiracy theorising”. 

You can't even be bothered to read Apple's privacy policy and you're saying I am engaging in conspiracy theories? 

Apple has full rights to share your PII with 3rd parties for any reasons they want. All the data categories listed under non-PII can be converted into PII whenever they feel like it. 

Apple and Google have a TAC agreement worth $12 billion dollars: 

https://www.mobilemarketer.com/news/goldman-apple-will-charge-google-12b-to-be-default-search-engine-in-2019/538469/

This includes keywords via search and siri. Apple's PP explicitly states that they collect search terms and they can convert them to PII (i.e. link them to you). You think they are just going to discard all those search terms just like that? Don't be naive.

Note that Mozilla, which also has a TAC agreement with Google explicitly states that they don't collect your search terms:

https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/

And this just the top of the iceberg. There are a multiple other publicly verified examples of them abusing people's privacy. 

Read their annual report (a document that has to be ""objective"" by law); the vast majority of references to privacy fall under the risks section. Why would this be? Is Apple just lying to their shareholders, but good old DDG totally knows the truth! Right?

But go on, feel free to dismiss me as a ""conspiracy theorist"" or a ""privacy maximalist."" Apple is a generic American tech company; they don't give a fuck about anything."

> How do you know this? Size alone isn't a valid metric when talking about privacy. What is in that data? What methodology was used to test this?

Given data size you can infer the quantity of information being relayed. Sure, we don't know the specifics of exactly what's being sent - but again through inference you can figure out that something's amiss when one device transmits <300MB of data and the other >1.6GB.

Their services are largely tied into their hardware and software ecosystem, and many these days are even paid-for services. They don't rely on advertising revenue and as a result have no reason to accrue user data relating to such; they'll accrue data for improving the service. And they have no need to gather that data to sell to third parties in their ecosystem because with the stronghold they have over the App Store there's absolutely no need to. I agree corporate greed is excessive and Apple are far from being a saint, but your position amounts to ""big company bad"" without consideration of how your suggestions would fit their business model and practices. Apple need to improve, as made abundantly clear with the ""contractors listening to Siri conversations"" issue recently - but my whole point here has been that at least they're making some headway and making it clear that they're interested in protecting user privacy to some extent, whereas Google have largely ignored the issue until now.

> You can't even be bothered to read Apple's privacy policy and you're saying I am engaging in conspiracy theories?

I'm well aware of their privacy policy, and there are issues with it that I wish would be addressed. Far too much of the data they deem to be non-PII isn't (or has the potential not to be), and I'd like better clarification on what exactly they share with third parties as well as which third parties they share that data to.

But it's a lot less concerning than Google's privacy policy. Which is the only point I've been making here; not that Apple are perfect, but that they're making enough of a push to protecting privacy that I trust them considerably more than I would ever trust Google.

> And this just the top of the iceberg. There are a multiple other publicly verified examples of them abusing people's privacy.

Such as? The only example I'm aware of is the aforementioned Siri one. Apple are guilty of a great many things, and have been accused of a great many more, but abusing user privacy isn't one I've come across with much credibility behind it.

I feel that I need to stress once again, *I am not saying Apple are perfect*. I can never wholly trust a company with my data when its services and technologies are closed-source and open to little in the way of external scrutiny; one of many reasons I've been a Linux user for years. But Apple have been making obvious improvements to protecting privacy, and even if you assume it to be inaccurate their massive marketing push for iOS as protecting user privacy would put the company in a pretty bad position if it ever came to light that user data is not being protected as they claim it is.

> But go on, feel free to dismiss me as a ""conspiracy theorist"" or a ""privacy maximalist."" Apple is a generic American tech company; they don't give a fuck about anything.

I'm not dismissing you, I'm disagreeing with you. There's a critical difference there.

Sure. But the lack of advertising is, imo, a very important distinction between themselves and Google. Apple still collect a lot of data I agree; but a lot of that data is necessary for services and features to work. ""Find My iPhone"" for example is an invaluable feature for anyone whose iPhone has been lost or stolen, but for the feature to work it needs to periodically update Apple's servers with the phone's location data. But so far as we know, that data is only used for that isolated feature - the location data isn't also used to influence targeted advertising, or throw up localised PoI suggestions and the like. Whereas with Google just about any data they collect may well be used to impact the nature of ads they target you with.

> Selling to 3rd parties isn't the only issue wrt digital privacy. Collecting data ""to improve the service"" is a massive red flag if it is not qualified. Technically speaking keeping a 2 year copy of all your search terms and browsing history could be used to ""to improve the service."" As per Apple's PP we literally have no idea of the full extent of their data collection (as all the data types listed under non-PII can be turned into PII at will).

I agree - but I'd question how valuable that kind of information would be for Apple. As a hardware and services company that sort of data just wouldn't seem relevant for them, to my mind. I agree that a lot of the ""non-PII"" info can easily be made into PII, but so long as that data isn't being sold or provided to third parties without user consent I don't think it's excessively concerning. Because they're not engaged with advertising, there's significantly less area for concern in how they use that data in my view.

Therein lies the key. I trust Apple much more with my data because I know it isn't being used to monitor, infer, and deploy advertisements based on the accumulation of my personal data, whereas with Google I'm fully aware that *anything* that touches any of their services can and probably will be used for that purpose. I don't mind some of my info being used to improve their services (provided it's as anonymised as practicably possible and they're transparent when they do it), I mind it being used for targeted advertising.

Privacy isn't just about the data companies gather, it's also about how they use that data. I don't trust Facebook because it collects a scary amount of data and uses it in terrible ways; I don't trust Google because it collects a scary amount of data and uses it in a way I disagree with; I trust Apple considerably more because they collect comparatively little data and use it in a way I agree with.

As I said before, I'm not aware of any instances of Apple abusing a user's privacy (short of when required to do so by Government) - aside from the Siri voice recording monitoring issue recently, which I strongly disagreed with. However they quite quickly responded to the backlash on that, and added a toggleable option for opting out of that, which I think is a fair compromise. 

> Apple only stopped listening in on Siri convos because they got caught. They would never stop otherwise.

I agree. And they were wrong for doing that; however I wouldn't say it can be used to suggest that they are equally zealous with how they use all other user data.

> Apple blocked UBO on Safari and forced everyone to use their approach to content filtering (Google got a lot of flak for doing something similar with Manifest V3). In general, they do everything they can to make it difficult to distribute open source software on iOS and MacOS.

The problem there is there are genuine reasons to block such add-ons and programs; they have the potential to invade user privacy just as much as they can protect it. uBO is legit so far as we know, but various other adblockers over the years have been guilty of maliciously using user data as well as allowing specific ""curated"" ads to show.

> In general, they do everything they can to make it difficult to distribute open source software on iOS and MacOS.

Other than annual costs for the Apple Developer Program, and per-program costs for adding a program to the App Store, I'm not aware of any particular difficulties open-source software faces in being distributed on Apple's ecosystem. The financial stuff is inconvenient for open-source developers who are accustomed to everything being free I know; but I'm not sure how Apple could improve that for them without creating a loophole through which profit-seeking businesses and individuals could evade those costs also.

> In addition to the ""What stays on your iPhone..."" lie, Tim Cook himself has lied many times about privacy (e.g. by saying they don't track your web browsing history; when the Apple/Google TAC and their PP suggests they do track your search queries).

From the article you linked earlier, all we know of the Apple/Google TAC is that Apple makes Google the default search engine on macOS' Safari and iOS. In the article you linked earlier I didn't notice anything suggesting that Google provide the resultant data back to Apple, and there's no apparent accusation that Apple ignore a user's engine preference and continue providing Google with user data even when they use a different search engine.

I agree, it sucks that Apple are taking money from Google to keep them as their ecosystem's default search engine. I'd much prefer they use something like DuckDuckGo by default. But at the same time the vast majority of those users would just be using Google anyway, and if users care enough to not like using Google they can change their default search engine in a second. It's not optimal, but at least user choice is being upheld there.

> Apple cooperates with the CCP; something neither Google or FB do (although I am sure they would love to).

Which is concerning, of course. But they also don't have much choice, and neither do any other big hardware tech companies; China's got such a strangehold on not only the manufacturing and production of electronics devices, but even the mining and sale of many of the resources and minerals required for such. If the tech companies were to oppose the CCP it's quite likely they'd face consequent difficulty in maintaining their production.

That said, I wish Apple would just pull out of china as a target market for their products and services. They may need to rely on China for production, but they shouldn't be abandoning their ethics to sell their stuff there.

> Apple has taken part in PRISM (in order to remove legal liability).

As an American tech company I'm not sure they had any choice in that. At any rate, PRISM and the NSA's activities are the responsibility of the US Government, not the companies mandated to comply with them. 

> Apple lied about the whole FBI case. They previously cooperated and unlocked device for the US government. The whole case wasn't really about unlocking a specific device.

They didn't lie. Previous cooperation was performed on iOS devices running a software version previous to 8.X. As a result of changes made to their FDE, they could no longer comply with such requests on devices running iOS 8 or above. 

> Again, I have no issues with people using Apple (or Google/FB/whatever). I think there are many reasons to choose Apple products (which I outlined in my OP), but privacy is definitely not one of them.

You've conceded yourself that they're not involved with advertising data like Google, and as shown in that video the quantity of data their devices transmit is considerably lower. Surely you can admit that of the two main smartphone operating systems, Apple seems a more logical choice for those who are privacy-conscious? Short of using a custom ROM and avoiding all Google apps and services on Android (which let's be honest results in a pretty poor experience, comparatively speaking), iOS inherently tracks less data and uses it in less invasive ways."

As log as you don't have a learning disability you can see that you're only choosing to believe the ones that match what you want to see.
5391,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",BobsBurger1,9896,2019-11-20 14:27:19,"No the majority say its caught up a lot but the pixel still takes better photos. And I'm some areas like night mode, portrait and zoom it's way ahead on the pixel. The iPhone 11 has equally good photos in perfect light outdoors but with a very distinct yellow warm tinge to them all which spoils it. 

iPhone is better in ultra wide and video only. 

And iPhone is almost £400 more expensive so it should be better. Yet it's not."
5392,"Google Pixel 4 review—Overpriced, uncompetitive, and out of touch",,9896,2019-11-20 21:11:03,"The iPhone definitely leans to the warmer white balance, while the pixel leans to the cooler side. Saying it has a tinge that spoils the photos is going way overboard though. You could say the same for the pixel if you wanted, that the blue tinge spoils it.

Here's one good comparison: https://www.tomsguide.com/face-off/pixel-4-vs-iphone-11-pro-camera

They highlight the difference in white balance, and the pixel isn't always closer to the real colours, nor always the better shot. They give the win to the iPhone.

Here's another with tonnes of comparison shots: https://mashable.com/feature/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review/

The reviewer likes the iPhone more, but read it more to compare the actual photos. The photos aren't overly yellow, and in ones where the people are wearing white shirts you can see that the pixel while balance is off as well, making the shirts have a blue tint. It's really down to preference in which white balance you prefer, and anyway you can just change the white balance in post or using a third party camera app anyway. What it shows is that the cameras are basically on par for normal shooting in terms of detail and quality."

5396,"Google Pixel 4: A 2,800mAh battery?",Naxthor,9896,2019-10-16 13:51:01,So the Pixel 4 has a smaller battery than previous and doesn't come with a aux adapter or headphones. Seems like a no brainer.
5397,"Google Pixel 4: A 2,800mAh battery?",RearAndNaked,9896,2019-10-16 15:56:19,I honest to god can't understand why Google can't get a phone right. They should go back to having a 3rd party build the thing.
5398,"Google Pixel 4: A 2,800mAh battery?",GazaIan,9896,2019-10-16 15:24:40,"The only way I can forgive a battery that small is if you're like the Moto Z and you're ridiculously thin along with it. When I had my Moto Z I was getting 4.5 hours of SOT with that tiny ass battery, but it was in a 5mm thin body. I was fine with that. The Pixel 4 is nothing like that, and it's paired with a 90hz display on top of it all. 

Honestly there's a lot of drawbacks with both this and the XL that hold me back. Going to a Pixel from my OnePlus 7 Pro feels like I'm downgrading, aside from the camera, which is the reason I want the phone at all."
5399,"Google Pixel 4: A 2,800mAh battery?",dlerium,9896,2019-10-16 16:05:23,"While the battery size is a concern, my biggest concern seems to be the overall performance of Pixel devices. My Pixel 3 XL as it is already gets significantly less SOT compared to my iPhone 8 Plus or XS Max. The XS series was noted for having less battery than its predecessors on Anandtech last year already, which is probably why Apple went back and really boosted the battery this year, so if my 3 XL isn't even beating that, then it's quite unfortunate.

I'd argue this is my experience year after year. I've used the 5, 6, 6s, 7, 8, and XS series now and every single year my Nexus/Pixel phones is no match in battery. While this is only one data point, the one year I went to OnePlus with the OPO, my battery felt fantastic and actually felt better than the competing iPhone.

It just seems to me Nexus & Pixel phones always punch below their weight for battery when you compare against other Android flagships, so it's not simply just battery capacity. We talk about optimization but it doesn't seem Google has even done this yet after so many years.

Finally, I've been critical about the whole 90 hz display thing. Android still has stutter, and there are leakers who also comment the Pixel 4 still shows stutters and dropped frames. To me it doesn't make sense to even push 90 Hz until the UI can constantly render 90 fps. I'd argue it makes more sense for Apple to go to 90 or 120 hz displays given that iPhones are rock solid smooth. And it's not like I don't appreciate higher refresh rates too. I have an iPad Pro next to me, and it does look nice, but I don't feel like I'm missing out when I use my XS Max or Pixel 3 XL. It's one of those nice to haves, but I'd rather wait until we nail the battery first."
5400,"Google Pixel 4: A 2,800mAh battery?",FFevo,9896,2019-10-16 15:17:49,"> During idle periods it’s probably not going to make a huge difference, but during high-load when the memory is being used, it will definitely consume more energy.

That's not really how that works. 6GB ram might draw more power than 4GB but it's pretty much constant. The power draw does not fluctuate with utilization to a degree that it's even measurable afaik."

Then the 3 had an awful notch paired with a huge chin, one camera, and a year old processor. 

Now the 4 is still behind the competition on cameras, has asymetical bezels, and a sub par battery. 

I wish Google would take the One Plus way of doing things and let Apple do the crazy shit to their phones. Give me stock Android, dual front facing speakers, a flat screen, symmetrical bezels, the triple camera, 6 GB of RAM, a rear fingerprint reader and an up to date processor and I'm sold.

I'm just starting to reach a point where I want to upgrade my S7 edge. I almost went with the S10 edge but at 3200mah I decided against it.

my S7 edge has 3600mah, and the battery is my ***most***  important feature by a large margin. I just flat out refuse to pay $1000CAD+ for a *brand new* phone thats a step ***down*** on my most important feature.

everyone talks about the shitty batteries of every phone, and they only want to talk about screen size and thickness of the phone, and ***anything else*** other than the battery. I just don't understand. If a phone manufacturer just came out and said ""hey we'd love to solve all your problems by throwing in a 40'000mah battery, but anything over 3500mah gets too big and dangerous because it can't bleed off the heat fast enough (or whatever) and we just don't feel comfortable putting it in a phone.""

I use my phone to keep up with several group chats, read emails as they arrive, take a picture or two a day, occasionally look something up online mid-conversation, play spotify in my car, maybe cast a couple videos to a TV, and quickly surf articles on google news or reddit if I get super bored.

If Google used machine learning and tweaked the CPU profile and optimized the pixel ROM enough, I don't see why it would get worst battery life than the pixel 3. I have used the adaptive battery feature on my pixel 2 and 3a and it absolutely helps me. I easily last a day with Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS and AOD enabled. 

iPhone users have gone through this a few times, less battery capacity doesn't always translate to worst battery life.

Although I agree that manufacturers should absolutely give us more battery capacity than less, if what they do give us lasts a full solid day, I'm fine with that. It's going to be awhile til we have flagship phones that are over specced, offer every feature and last 2-3 days."

Like say, give atleast 5 hours sot on a, yes heavy usage, including a gaming, video surfing, even clicking pictures which is the biggest USP of pixel.

This capacity battery after a year would drop by around an hour of SOT, which would already not be high. That's why it's bad. Yes this could just be Google's way of saying that you buy the expensive one, and if that's the case, they should know that this is a bad strategy. And I hope people make Google realise that by not buying this joke of a phone bcoz honestly, there are much better options available at much cheaper. And if you really want a camera that bad, buy a cheaper 300$ 3a and invest the remaining 5-600$  on a good frickin camera. 

You're buying a flagship so it can do all things well, but if it can't even last long enough bcoz of a puny battery, well it's unfortunate."

Battery life doesn't matter day to day anymore for me, just means that when I'm traveling or something I'll need to bring a battery pack since I depend on my phone to navigate around cities and take photos. I'd prefer a larger battery, just saying less than a day battery life doesn't suck as much with wireless charging pads being a thing that I set my phone on all the time.

Plus there's always fast charge if I need to top up quick.

5756,"Google Pixel 4: A 2,800mAh battery?",johnmountain,9896,2019-10-16 15:32:36,"> Processor is more efficient 

97% of the time people take this to mean that the ""processor will use less power"".

No, that's almost never the case. A new processor design or the same processor being manufactured on a small process can create a ""more efficient processor"" but it doesn't mean it will use less battery than before overall. 

Why? It's simple - because the chipmaker will usually increase the performance of the chip to ""compensate"" for that extra efficiency, leading to roughly the same power consumption as before - just better performance than before.

This usually stops being true when we hit a hard plateau in terms of performance increases, and then some manufacturers, such as Intel for instance (a few years ago, not now), start promoting how much less power their new designs need - but that's because they couldn't increase the performance, and it's better for them to promote ""-15% less power draw"" than ""+3% increase in performance"".

Going back to our story, the process could now be used more to do AI stuff, pick-up your voice commands more, ""always listen"" more and all of that stuff, more advanced computational photography, now that it's ""more efficient"". But doing all of those extra activities = higher power draw."

OnePlus and Samsung have provided better life than the Pixel 3. It feels like Google doesn't really want people to buy the Pixel 4 on mass. It seems like it's a ""spec phone"" that they use to experiment with.

They don't 10s of millions of Pixel users. I'm not sure why. They are losing their small affluent Android base to Apple. So I would have thought they would have made a fabulous model by now in most respects. What is Google thinking?"

That being said it’s a stupid fucking reason. If even Apple put a 3046 mah in their base 11 when their chips and OS are already leagues more efficient at power consumption, there’s no excuse for putting a 2800mah in your flagship.

I don’t understand what Googles thinking, the pixel line already sells poorly, why alienate your pro customers who actually buy your devices."

5841,"Google Pixel 4: A 2,800mAh battery?",dingo_bat,9896,2019-10-16 14:43:54,Explanation: pixel is bought only by fanboys and fanboys don't give a shit about specs. They'd buy it even if they have to charge it thrice a day.
5842,"Google Pixel 4: A 2,800mAh battery?",lengau,9896,2019-10-16 15:45:22,"I guess I would fit in that category. The vast majority of the time (as in... 350+ days of the year), my Pixel 3 ends the day with >30% battery life. In the times when it wouldn't last the entire day, I would need a battery so much bigger that it would be pointless to have most of the time, and on those days I'm never in a position where it would be an inconvenience for me to carry a battery pack. (I have a 20+ Ah Anker battery pack, and in those circumstances my fiancee and I tend to take it from fully charged to empty between just our two phones - and no, a 10 Ah battery in my phone would not be great for me.)

This is also likely why the Pixel 3a does have a bigger battery. Its target audience **does** require more battery life."

5853,"Google Pixel 4: A 2,800mAh battery?",lovingfriendstar,9896,2019-10-16 16:24:34,"There shouldn't be. If I have to say in simple but maybe inaccurate terms, mAh is a measure of energy and has nothing to do with quality. A 2800mAh battery will supply only 2800mAh of electricity no matter how it's made, no more, no less.

Improvements in battery tech comes from energy density of batteries, i.e. the same physical volume of chemicals can supply more energy than the older compounds. By increasing density, physically smaller batteries will be able to supply equal amount of energy. Maybe a better use of lithium ion, or using new materials like graphene will allow for higher capacity batteries in the same physical size."

1. The device only uses 90hz when you're scrolling and ramps back to 60 otherwise.

2. That's actually why they didn't go for 855+, which is more for gaming devices and eats up battery. The 855 isn't that hungry.

3. Radar chip uses almost no power, and actually helps battery power by turning things down when it detects you're away from the phone.

The S10e has a 3100mAh battery...just 10% larger than the P4.  The iPhone 11 Pro has a 3,050 mAh battery, about 9% larger than the P4.  

I think everyone would like a larger battery, but the circlejerk likes to make it out as if this thing will last half the length of any similar phone.  It might be 10-15% worse than something like the S10e.  If that's the case, you go from 6 hours of SoT to around 5 hours 15 minutes.

Sure, I forgot the infinite Pixel-exclusive storage. For every other phone it's limited and so.. guess what? It gets full.

I don't consider some dinky pop up camera or things like that to be innovation. It may be a new feature and different, but it isn't innovation. I just don't think it's realistic to expect substantial changes between model years every single time. I mean just look at cars. Sure, they change a little bit and get refinements. But based on the innovation expected from smart phone manufactures, we should have had flying cars in like the 1980's.

My point isn't to compare those two industries, but to illustrate that much like cars I think that smart phones are kind of reaching their ""final form."" At least for the foreseeable future. Generally speaking, the current design is pretty great, people like it, and are used to it. A thin rectangle with a high quality touch screen and good cameras. That is basically what people want at the end of the day, and that's basically what *all* smart phones are. I just honestly don't see that general design changing any time soon. And with that, you are limited in what you can change. You can make the screen nicer, battery better, better processor, etc. But you can't *really* change the phone that much without just starting all over again with a new design."

Also I think the rest of your statement could use some caveats. (For example, Apple doesn't guarantee support for any specific period of time on the iPhone. Google guaranteed at least 2 years of feature updates on the OG Pixel and has so far provided 3 years. While that's less than what Apple has, I think it's fair to say we don't really have enough data to say what the software update status of the Pixels looks like in comparison to the iPhones.)"
6360,"Google Pixel 4: A 2,800mAh battery?",lengau,9896,2019-10-16 15:37:59,"The flip side of that argument is that the target market for the Pixel 4 is probably office workers, who do tend to have their phones near a charger all day. And at the times when they don't (e.g. when they're flying somewhere), they're likely to have either chargers near them most of the time (including in the seats on the aeroplane) or be carrying so much with them that adding a battery pack isn't a problem.

The Pixel 3a is more aimed at the people who will be out and about all the time. And if I'm right about that, we should expect to see a Pixel 4a in early 2020 with a decent IP rating and a big battery, as well as probably Soli and face recognition (both likely to be a bigger deal for those markets - face recognition with sunglasses or safety glasses on being more likely to work than fingerprint recognition with gloves on).

They are not in the same level in hardware...and software it's becoming evident that they are lost, and with these decisions are they expecting to sell? I mean, they show and launch apps that one year later are beeing replaced or just gone...still can't find a way to increase the updates, they have 2 years or support? 3 maximum? 

I'm a huge fan of Android I've been using android my entire life, galaxy s2, nexus 7, nexus 5, Nvidia Shield tablet, galaxy s6, huawei mate 10 pro, all great devices in their own way but at the same time I can see a difference between some of my friends still using old iPhones and things seem to be working well. 

I even made some of my friends buy android. Some of them regret it and changed to iOS, others just don't care and are not heavy users...

But Holy shit Google how hard can it be to make a good phone? If it's not the battery it's the screen, if not the screen it's some bug (I don't even remember anymore if it was the nexus 6p or nexus 6)...and if it's not that it's the stock (remember the first pixels? ) 

Ffs let's not even begin to talk about the number of countries that have been waiting their products to be available and it's just impossible to get one, people don't even know what Google is making hardware wise...it's just sad honestly, how can a company like Google don't have their products available worldwide? 

I think that they need to step up their game, seriously! And I mean... No one at Google/android/alphabet can make this happen?

It's just an opinion, sorry for the long reply.

Pixel is a pretty small phone and has the exact same specs and features as the larger XL, which is something other manufacturers don't do. they always cut features on the smaller phone. Of course fitting all of that in a smaller phone is just not feasible without other sacrifice, but it has nothing to do with cost cutting."

1. Default apps. This one is incredibly frustrating not to have
2. Difficulty in installing third-party apps (I'm uncomfortable with the amount of control Apple can exert over what you have in your phone)
3. Nova launcher. I've got this whole system figured out where I have just 1 homescreen that I ever use to launch all my apps. Been porting the same setup over 3 devices at this point.
4. Managing photos between my phone and windows computer. It's a massive PITA that really is just drag and drop for Android
5. Not really an iOS thing as it's hardware related, but non-usb c connectors mean that I can't have just one cable for my Switch, Laptop and Phone for travelling. Also new cables (that are slightly more expensive than usb C ones)
6. Picture-in-picture mode, love being able to watch YouTube/Netflix while browsing Reddit, sending a text, etc.

I'd assume they did it to save space. It's quite a small and compact device.  Look at the iPhone 11 though, it is a larger device than the Pixel 4 (.15"" taller, .27"" wider, and .01"" thicker) yet only has 3110 mAh battery.  The Galaxy S10, while slightly thinner than the Pixel 4, is also quite a bit taller and wider than the Pixel 4 and only sports a 3400 mAh battery.

From a quick search (here: https://www.phonescoop.com/phones/finder_results.php?w=s&avr=r&av_2=y&bar=r&bav=4000&prr=0&dir=0) it seems that the phones with 4000 mAh or larger batteries are all physically much larger devices.

When you use ur phone for business and no games etc in my case with using a lot of Reddit,Twitter,instagram. All my lights are Philips hue and I got a lot of assistant devices like sonos and Google minis. I always got a small Powerbank when it should run out. I really don't get people complaining so much about battery life. My old iPhone X has a 2,700mah battery.Ofc no 90hz screen etc but, you know that.before you buy it and I I could get an XL but I bought the 4 for a reason and that is it's size.

If they can cram in a 6kmAh battery, A 120hz screen, 12gb RAM, the latest CPU, a Vapor Chamber and much more that is uneeded for the average consumer, i'm sure Google can do the same and slap their Software on top of that, which is what you're mostly paying for.
Also please don't say it's a GaMeR PhEuN. Nowhere it says non-gamers are exempt to use them. Obviously you'll get longer battery life compared to the Pixels if you're not playing high demanding games.

Stop this nonsense. The bias is really showing. He claimed it'll have normal battery life with 90HZ and a radar chip whilst having a 2800 mAh battery. Let me repeat, A 2800. MAH. BATTERY. Fucking joke. 90HZ has a very SUBSTANTIAL impact on battery life AS PROVEN through the OnePlus 7 pro, XDA Deb's mod that turns it on 24/7(the op 7 pro has a continuously variable 90HZ as does pretty much every panel above 60HZ ffs this isn't some special Google optimization. Have you seen the Asus rog phone 2? Have you seen the battery life it gets with a 6k mAh cell? YEA, it turns off when watching a video or paused on an article for extended periods of time, no shit, nobody cares, every already knows.

As if this counterclaim is supposed to debunk it, or even midigated the overall drain. While it obviously helps the battery from comitting suicide, it DRAINS and with these terrible cells sub par is the last thing I want from a 800 dollar phone, what an absolute shitheap. The s10+ that's 750 dollars new would humiliate this phone, even a op 7 pro would at 650$, and SO WOULD an iPhone 11. Same with every other Redmi, xiaomi, vivo, Huawei, oppo, and Samsung phone in the 500-900 range. Obviously excluding year old flagships but instead including their new, A range devices from Samsung.

The battery life will be bad, this is a joke. The pixel 4 is dead, long live Samsung and other companies who wouldn't laugh in the consumers face this much. Maybe you can listen to some relaxing music to drown out the sounds oh wait you can't because the pixel 4 didn't include headphones in the box or a dongle of course, yep, Google actually did that in 2019, on a 900 dollar flagship phone. How anyone supports this is beyond me.

It lacks the telephoto but has everything else, in fact it’s physical fingerprint scanner works better than the in display ones in the S10/S10+. Samsung did a better job with the S10e compared to what google did with the pixel 4 in my opinion. That phone has WiFi 6, headphones in the box and a headphone jack. 

Wait for the reviews is cool but the fact remains that the price is $799 for this. Ppl have complained about the pixel 3 battery life, I don’t see what makes you think this will be any different, if not worse now that a 90hz refresh rate is on board. To me that’s just adding 2 and 2 together."

AFAIK for some industrial devices, for example, like some barcode readers where lifespan and reliability is key, the minimum and maximum capacity (or voltage) are changed. In other words, if the device says it's at 1%, it might actually be at 20% (or whatever) and when it says 100%, it might only be at 70%. That way it can be cycled way more times as it only gets charged from 20 to 70.

Also, there's an app called AccuBattery I'm using, in which you can see the estimated ""cycle wear"" depending on how much you want to charge your phone. You can set limits at which point it notifies you to disconnect the charger (but of course it can't stop the charginh process). And from 90% each charged percentage adds more and more wear. Like the last two percentages are both 0.07-0.07 wear and from 26% to 88% is 0.36 cycles wear. I used to set it to 94%."

MORE damage is done if you maintain an high charge rate when the battery is critically low, and nearly at capacity (this is why people always say keep your battery between 20-80% or some variant of that.) 

But if a battery is capable of discharging at 5v and 1 amp, and you cram 5v 3amp down it's pipe you're effectively doing 3c charge which has been shown to significantly reduce lifespan of the battery (my understanding... I could be wrong on the c-value calculation.)

That's the point. Fast charging aggravates several issues that damage the electrode or prevent Li from migrating between cathode and anode properly.

Other things that can do battery fade is heat cycles or amount of charging cycles."

I have a Pixel 3 right now. I know exactly what the battery life is like. Again, it's nothing amazing, but it finishes the day at like 10%.

> It was consequently beaten by mostly every other Android flagship in the pixel 3 XL's range.

Wait now were comparing it to the XL?

> AS PROVEN through the OnePlus 7 pro

OnePlus 7 pro did not have adaptive framerate, which is why there's an actual option in the settings to use 60fps. They later implemented something to use 60fps when watching videos, but that's basically it.

It also doesn't have a Soli chip, which can significantly battery usage when away from the phone

> Have you seen the Asus rog phone 2

That's actually 120 fps, and also isn't adaptive. The only other real adaptive display is the iPad. ROG also has a much beefier gaming CPU. Pixel intentionally went for the non-gamer CPU for this very reason. 12GB of ram also eats up your battery, as do many other things in those gamer phones.

> The battery life will be bad

Who knew asking people to fucking wait for actual **data** instead of talking out of their ass would be such a controversial thing... Jesus christ. Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong.

I definitely don't think it'll be much better than Pixel 3, I agree the smaller pixels have pretty underwhelming battery life depending on your use. It works fine if you charge it a little throughout the day (with fast charge). But a lot of people think the battery will be much worse than Pixel 3, which I'm saying is not necessarily true."

Changing the length/width of a phone completely changes the aesthetic of the phone by affecting other things like screen size or bezels, wherease changing the thickness pretty much only affects well, the thickness.

Current phones are arguably **too** thin already, so most people wouldn't mind if they were thicker.

Everybody is obviously talking about thickness and it's not our fault that you can't follow the context.

On windows, you aren't going to get any categories, or any sort of organization to the photos.

Vietnam's stance toward political dissent, democracy etc are not exactly new.
As for Vietnam's treatment toward ethnic and religious minorities, just look up the Hoa, the Chams ethnic minorities etc. 
As for the territorial claims part, have you ever looked at Vietnam's claims over the South China Sea? Vietnam's claim not only overlaps with that of China's, but also significantly so with that of the Philippines and less so with Malaysia's, Brunei's etc. Out of the various islands that's in contention with Philippines, Vietnam actually occupies alot more islands than China. For the island in contention with Malaysia & Brunie, Vietnam occupies a couple of them while China don't actually occupy any of them. Vietnam is not only also in the island building shenanigan as well, but it actually seems like they started their island building before China."

Not true at all lmao.

It will drain the battery, and it's doing it no good with those shit battery capacities. I'm well aware the rog phone 2 is 120HZ, I know fps and HZ are very similar but just call it HZ lol it's used for displays.

When I said the pixel 3 I meant the pixel 3 XL too, just like when people s10 and note 10 I'm reviews they're usually reviewing the + unit as per MKBHD, unbox therapy, etc. And oh God still 6 gigs ram for a 900 dollar phone holy hell.

And soli chip, that only decreases battery I think you left out a word but it seemed like you implied that it actually aided the battery, it'll reduce it by maybe a few percent like NFC does but it all counts when the battery is this lame.

To claim that this will somehow have average battery life with 90HZ and terrible battery sizes is abhorrent. And goes against pretty much ALL mainstream Huawei, Samsung, vivo, and xiaomi Android smartphones in that price range. This is inane.

But yeah, and as the comment below states, pixels have been KNOWN for sub par battery life are you actually disagreeing with this? It's just price gouging, the pixel 3 does not have good battery life and that's a literal fact comparatively. Same with the XL for the price."

Samsung decided to not use that feature in OneUI/Touchwiz, meaning apps in the app draw are left open, allowing for better/more convenient multitasking but also taking a hit on battery life. You can mitigate this using an app like Greenify or Tasker (or even in developer options by not allowing background processes).

Many fast charge technologies, such as qualcomm quick charge, work by increasing the voltage coming into the phone from to 9V.  The problem is that the battery still charges at 5V, so somewhere in the phone the voltage has to be regulated back down to 5V. This generates heat. 

Many OEMs are switching to more clever designs, which increase the current while keeping the voltage at 5V, and so generate much less heat. This is probably still not as good for battery health as slow charging, but it's definitely a massive improvement."

I say that just to show you I’m not bias and just love tech. The iPhone 11 display is REALLY good imo. The fact that it’s lcd and sub 1080p is absolutely a non issue.

That and the camera is kinda crappy. Hoping the umidigi f2 with 128GB of UFS 2.1 storage will run faster, get similar battery life, and also have a better camera due to using a larger sensor that has 1.6um pixels at 12MP vs 1.25um for the g7 power camera, plus a wider aperture f1.8 vs f2.0 in the g7 power.

As I commented before the Galaxy S10 has basically the same battery size as the Pixel 3xl in a much smaller form factor, with a tonne more features packed in. Google have no excuse, for putting in a smaller battery in their phones. People keep saying wait for the reviews as if we haven't used any of the components in the Pixel 4 before, 

1- the S855 isn’t some magic battery saving chip, and gains over the S845 in regards to battery consumption are negligible at best! 

2- A 90hz screen WILL seriously drain battery life as has been observed with the Razer phone (which has a much larger battery) and the Oneplus which also has a form of adaptive refresh, so I think we can confidently predict that the pixel isn’t going to fair any better with their substantially smaller battery. 

3- We have been using android 10 for well over a month, and again it doesn’t provide any kind of noticeable improved battery life.

There isn’t anything here to indicate that the Pixel 4 will have acceptable battery life for the price it is being sold at, but there are a lot things which point as to why it won’t. 

At this point even google fan boys like me have ran out of patience. Google got away with this with their nexus phones as at the time stock Android was much better than iOS which it now it isn’t, plus they labelled it as “dev phone” and priced it in the lower end/mid range market. The pixel line was meant to be different, a flagship phone with all the bells whistles, the dogs bollocks off phones, however after 4 iterations, the only thing that is different is that Google have tried to rip off Apple - badly I might add, with horrible design choices, end of cycle hardware and horrible battery life.

If this was a small company no one would complain, but it’s Google, one of largest and richest tech companies in the world, they should be setting the benchmark and leading in the market in mobile phone design and technology, instead they sell us watered down beer and charge us champagne prices!"

Yes that's what I said from the beginning. But I'm replying not just because it ""isn't for me"", but because you asked in a previous comment what about iOS was dated.

It's a straight up lie.  Now, I'm not saying you're lying, I'm sure you believed the claim when you bought that thing, but the company that sold you that battery is lying.  And it's potentially unsafe, you should probably not have that battery in your phone.

While that's great and all, it really is only an feature appreciated in the north american market. The rest of the world doesn't really care all that much, so for the rest of the world, this is almost a non-feature.

Still, that's just one example of one kind of app that you might want to change.

Opera Mini is a great web browser that is built from the ground up for slow and/or limited data connections.

You might want to change your file manager because it mixes with your workflow better, or supports file sharing over a network that works with your PCs.

I'm not trying to argue the value of one-specific app over one-specific market, for one specific use-case. But the fact that iOS doesn't support basic default app settings forces users to jump through stupid and unnecessary hoops if they need to use anything than the default apple provided options. One of the parts of iOS I would definitely call dated and would like to see changed in future revisions"

I travel a decent amount and I often find myself wanted to get a wide angle shot only to be stuck with panorama on my pixel 2. I don't want to upgrade to the 4 and still be stuck with that limit.

iPhone does look like a way better option because they are taking the camera versatility more seriously. From the main, to the telephoto, to the wide angle they are giving a lot of options. And they are taking video seriously where google seems ok with a video offering that would have been behind the times 3 generations ago."

7176,[MKBHD] Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,,9896,2019-10-22 02:46:23,"To me the biggest flaw is the battery life. I don't think Google deserves all the hate it's getting, though. Apple this year rebranded it's ""budget"" phone to be the main iPhone 11, introduced a ""pro"" line that's really just the iPhones from the last 2 years, and almost entirely focused on only the cameras. The design is almost identical to last year's, with an unsightly camera bump. One of my roommates was incredibly excited for the event. He was hoping for new features like power share, an in-display fingerprint sensor, usb-c, a smaller notch, a higher refresh rate, and *significantly* better face id. He didn't get any of that and was let down. Yet mostly every reviewer gave it high praise.

Google tried for the first time to lead in hardware in some categories. They beat Samsung to a 90hz display. They're experimenting with a whole new radar technology that could potentially revolutionize their product line (it's first gen release software. Yes I was hoping it'd be as good as the original soli demo, but even the best engineers have limitations when introducing new technology on a wider scale). They brought the Google assistant down from 100 GB to 500 MB and loaded it onto a coprocessor. They completely redesigned the devices. They increased screen to body ratio. They honestly did quite a bit that's impressive, yet everyone is saying it's not worth it because it doesn't have that ultrawide and it doesn't have 4k60. 

Would I have loved to have those features? Yes, absolutely. I'm disappointed that ultrawide isn't there. Compare the difference between the 4/3 to the the 3/2, however, and you'll see some significant improvements. Overpriced? Maybe. A solid improvement? I think so."
7177,[MKBHD] Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,,9896,2019-10-22 05:02:30,how did they get the a line so right but the flagship line so wrong? guess I'll wait for the 5a.. when it has a wide angle lense?
7178,[MKBHD] Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,Demi-Fiend,9896,2019-10-22 07:20:37,This makes my realise how good midrange phones are these days.  My 180 USD Redmi note 7 pro gives 10 hours Sot normally or about 6 hours of pubg mobile continuously. It's shameful that Pixel 4 costs 5x more yet has less than half the battery life. I installed modded gcam on my phone and now camera quality is as good as that of an average flagship. Didn't like miui so installed pixel experience. Runs perfectly and I have yet to run into any bugs. Pixel experience even has ota support so updating is as easy as stock roms. I couldn't be happier.
7179,[MKBHD] Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,evanroden,9896,2019-10-22 18:51:59,"God damn it, Google, why?

You have a telephoto lens, but it's 2x. Why not more?

You have a 90hz screen, but you lock it at 60 for most of the time to improve battery life.

And when you force it to 90, you only get an hour of screen on time?

And video recording is just awful?

And you get rid of the free storage that comes with the phone that you were known for?

And you make it more expensive than the iPhone 11?

And you get rid of the fingerprint sensor?

And you can unlock it with your face when it's closed?

And you don't let us choose 4K30 because you ""want us to save storage"", which I guess makes sense because you gave us only 64gb on the base model, and you can't back it up to the cloud anymore for free anyway, so there's nowhere to put the footage.

And you got rid of dual front-facing speakers
And Motion Sense is just a gimmick
And the camera hasn't really improved. You took away the wide-angle for the selfie and didn't add a good replacement.

Why not do something interesting? What about an extra ultra-high resolution camera, and use your software and a second sensor to reduce the noise? Or maybe a 10x zoom lens for really interesting shots of things you just can't take close-ups of (like the head of the statue of liberty)

And why not do something interesting with the Radar? Maybe put it on the other side and keep the features? Having to not have to turn the phone over to change music makes more sense (same with calls and alarms), and could you use the RADAR for 3D mapping? Could you put it on the other side and have us move the phone around an object and it create a 3D model? That would be cool.

Why not make it thicker, put a bigger battery in, a real 90hz screen, a headphone jack, twice the expandable storage to start, keep the free storage, take $150 off the price, and add a wide angle to both sides of the phone? Or would that just have been impossible?"

I mean, like he said, we all knew what this phone was going to be, but I think we all kept sort of hoping that there was some secret sauce in the mix that would make what appeared to be a lackluster set of specs combined with questionable design .. not just.. suck.

I'm on a 2-year cycle with my phones (ignoring broken / replacements / lost it / left it on top of the car, etc.) and hadn't seriously planned on replacing my Pixel 3 this time around anyway, but, I also _might_ have, if the device had been something awesome.

Users: ""Ugly, copycat notch! I'd rather have a full forehead instead!"", ""Single camera? C'mon Google, you can do so much with one, why not use two like everyone else?"", ""No face unlock? You could at least try to match Apple and justify that hideous notch with it.""

Pixel 4: No notch, 90Hz display, new industrial design, face unlock (with new technology that makes it super fast), and multiple cameras.

&#x200B;

I'm not blind to the shortcomings of this phone in terms of features and (arguably) price...none of us are, but to say that Google didn't *attempt* to make it competitive and forward-looking is pretty disingenuous. The methods they used and the decisions they made might not be exactly the ones we all wanted, but they clearly were trying to move on from a disappointing Pixel 3 with a more envelope-pushing device.

I have a 2xl that I've loved for the last two years, but come Thanksgiving, I'll be getting a 4xl. It's still going to be the best way to experience Android the way Google truly envisions it, and that's what I'm here for. If I wasn't, I suppose I'd already have a One Plus 7Pro."

I agree with the statement that this phone is not worth the premium price. But the same argument I would make for an iPhone for similar reasons.

The comparison to be made is to phones half the price with the same features. These companies are just milking the seemingly inelastic demand for smartphones. ""Seemingly""  because the demand is slowing down and causing companies to make budget lines, i.e. iPhone 11 and Pixel 3a."

It really seems that this year apple has outdone themselves, the 11 is missing the better screen and ultrawide camera of the pro.

I think the most interesting things are happening in the mid-range segment right now, especially with chinese phones.

It's impossible to justify buying these phones at retail prices to anyone. I can't tell anyone why they should buy it and not the iPhone, the Note, the S10 or even the OnePlus. There's the camera but frankly in blind tests no one, literally no one, can tell which photos came from which phone better than random chance so that's a really dishonest way to try to sway them just because Google and fans say it's the best.

What Google makes are midrange, ""good"" phones. But they're charging flagship iPhone and Note prices, prices for GREAT phones while just pushing out a decent phone. That's why they never sell well at or near launch. They don't start moving until Google drops them to where they belong, like the 3XL last January - $399 to a peak of $499."

The iPhone 11 costs 50 bucks less than the XR did when it came out, that was a “budget” phone. Apple understood that high end phone sales were declining and therefor pivoted there naming and marketing, nothing wrong with that. In the iPhone 11 you get EVERYTHING from the pro minus a third camera and the screen. You still get two of the best cameras, fastest processor, insane battery life, long support and more for 699! The pro is even better for those that want it. 

The reason everyone likes the new iPhone 11 is because Apple focused on what makes smartphones good and absolutely nailed it. The new 11 pro is amazing. Best screen in a phone, best camera in a phone, best video in a phone, definitely improved Face ID so fast you don’t miss Touch ID, added night sight, added another camera lense. They removed 3D Touch which nobody uses and replaced it with more battery to give you some of the best battery life on any phone. Apple went to the core of what makes phones good and killed it. 

What did pixel do? 
Radar technology? Umm Samsung used these same “gestures” 5 years ago. It was a gimmick then and a gimmick now. The last company I expect to follow through and create anything good out of the tech is google. 

90hz? Okay but it’s only on some of the time, and the battery’s are smaller to try and run this display? That’s stupid 

Camera? Zoom over wide angle?? Why? The wide angle is preferred by way more people 

Chins? Okay keep the Chins on there but you take away the front facing speakers? That’s what the Chins were there for in the first place. 

The pixel 4 feels like a downgrade from the pixel 3. Only is on this sub would try to pass their new phone as a great advancement. Google is just trying to get headlines with all this “new tech” that doesn’t improve day to day use at all. 

Also this sub always argued for the consumers experience - as expansion, removable battery, better screens, etc. times have changed but Apple with their new phone built something to genuinely improve consumer experience and we gotta respect that"

seriously, I've started off on Saturday with GPS and BT and throwing a video in the car for my kids to watch, sneaking a few clash royale games when the kids were doing their activity (at the park), using Samsung pay to pay dinner... from 9am to 7pm, my battery still had 43% battery life.  The only thing tthat I did do was enable the power save mode to medium.  other than that, i'm very happy.

reverse wireless power share, this happened last week at work, co-worker left his phone in his car and it drained down.  He had to call his wife (but the battery was dead), so I reversed charged the phone while the entire team were out eating dinner.  minutes later, he's got enough juice to call his wife and then charged again to get a tad more juice to GPS home.  he made it! :)

I have a 512GB extra storage, I flew (today) and including layover, over 8 hrs.  my Note 10+ battery had 35% left and I watched Xmen, StarWars 7, and played 2048.

I think the real gripe people have here is that they are not a new company. They're not a start-up, they're not struggling, this isn't their first phone rodeo.

This phone would probably be highly praised if it had come from a newer company and this was their first or second try of things on a somewhat restricted budget.

How many phones has Google made now? How many billions of dollars do they have for R&D?

It's as if Lamborghini had built the MR2 this year and called it a competitor to the 720s or 458 lmao.

Also, there is nothing envelope-pushing here, unless you're talking about the fucking dense looking forehead on the thing literally pushing envelopes around. Face unlock? 2+ years old elsewhere. High refresh displays? Done, and done better by others. Radar? I like the idea but it's like a car with 3 wheels, it just ain't ready. 

And that's the thing with the Radar tech, they may have just very well killed the whole project by releasing it in the state it's in. Now, most people (not the forum dwelling echo chamber nerds) will see tech that doesn't work well or do much at all, not use it, and never adapt to using it how it could've been used.

Yes, but it feels inevitable. Google just refuses to make the best hardware they can. I actually like radar because at least it's innovative and they may find better uses for it (I'm hoping for an accurate radar gun). Generally, Google has very little hardware innovation and relies on their software, but as soon as competitors catch up on things like photo processing, Google doesn't have good hardware to justify buying the phone anymore.

The sad part is that a base of 256 GB of storage (allowing 4k60 video) and a 20% larger battery is probably all they needed to add to make Pixel 4 competitive. They just don't think that having good specs is important, but reviews and experience tell us that some specs are very important."

Thinking ahead for next year I got the orange for ""limited edition"" (I put in a case anyway for me, though pink button combo is weird) and 128 GB on the storage. 

I really thought long and hard about the s10e though, and I might even go back to 1+ (their shitty support and abandonment of the X drove me away) if they would ever make a non-phablet again since I don't mind flashing (though would prefer not to). I really dig having latest Android OS and a great normal camera though, which ultimately kept me on-board for another cycle.

But you're right. This is ridiculous. When you look at the small index card next to the devices at a cell phone store I don't know how anyone could justify getting a Pixel over a Samsung Galaxy or iPhone 11 that's already cheaper and has better specs. The only hardware feature Google got right with the Pixel 4 was the 90Hz screen but then they didn't even include a massive battery to support it all day. And they don't have 60 fps 4k video because it would take up too much space? Then increase the storage! It's not that difficult and these are some of the cheapest hardware parts out there as well. Instead they include a radar chip that provides minimal real world utility while doing the same thing for the facial unlock that a proximity sensor, accelerometer, and gyroscope could've done but the Soli chip does it just a split second faster and probably for more cost since the technology is so new. What the hell are they thinking? I understand that Google is a software company that only provides hardware to show off their software but if they aren't going to put a complete package of flagship hardware together for their supposed flagship device then they either need to get out of the hardware game completely (which I would love if OEM's made Google Play Editions again) or stop trying to pretend that their devices are flagships that deserve to cost over $1000 after tax and warranty, etc."

It's definitely worth taking a step back outside of all prejudices and looking at what you use your phone for, I think in a lot of cases most people would be very happy with an iPhone. I ended up switching to the 8+ after it released over the pixels just because of that experience and am picking up an 11 pro max because there is honestly nothing worth switching back to android for. I want my phone to be fast, take good pictures (quickly, with no effort needed), stream music and most important for me have a great battery life.

I loved/still love my 2XL, always preferred android, and was so ready for the 4XL but it just left me underwhelmed with the battery being my main concern considering I'm a power user and my 2XL doesn't last a day.

Meanwhile, apple managed to significantly close the gap over the last two years on all the other things I care about: a smooth OS, updates, settings (take that with a grain of salt), support, and a great camera. So I picked up the pro max. That being said iOS is STILL not as feature packed as android  and I'm still getting used to notification handling but for what it's worth, this phone has been amazing between the screen and the battery.

But you're right. I should swing by my local TMO store and check it out in person. But if suitably impressed, would order straight from one plus.

Does the 7t have dual SIM slots? I run 2 Sim cards on my op3. One TMO and 1 at&t. I'd probably switch the at&t sim to Verizon with a new phone that's compatible. The op3 is not compatible with vzw."

I had those gestures on my Galaxy s4 and tried them a few times and never again. Unworthy. And that phone did not age well like my op3 has.

What happened to all these neat and funky features Samsung?

Edit: Yes, I know that at the end of the day these gimmicks weren't very practical and was often just bloat. I just sometimes miss those days of Android where phone brands were just going balls to walls with features and gimmicks that were fun to show off (at the time) and set it's apart from iOS.

Xiaomi have devices like the Mi 9SE which admittedly isn't stock android but is cheaper and the better device specs wise. (More ram, more storage, better battery, better Amoled screen and a better CPU)

Obviously MIUI is a bit of bummer but from my experience it's honestly not too bad at all. It's not much dissimilar to One UI from Samsung.

I get that the whole idea of a pixel is the user experience and completely clean software, but devices like the Nokia 8.1 are coming with completely stock android and are better specced than the 3a for less.

As I said, I like the 3a. I just feel Google have dropped a good bit in terms of their devices these last few years. The Nexus lines were fantastic. The Pixel devices since the Pixel 2 have been a little lacklustre in my opinion, with the latest being just not a great buy all around. The 3a sits in the weird in between.

I don't know how *both* of you managed to screw this up...

No, [it's **3 years period**](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en), including security updates. And I have no idea where you got ""likely more"" -- IIRC updates tend to stop on the exact month listed on that site.

Which is an improvement from older Pixels and Nexuses, where it was only 2 years of OS updates and 3 years of security updates. But they've never supported phones for longer than 3 years, while Apple generally supports phones longer than 5 years. Apple has Google beat by almost a factor of two here.

What makes this truly sad is that, until recently, Apple phones were supported for longer than Google *laptops.* Google ""fixed"" that by extending Chromebook support to 6.5 years, but phones are still stuck with 3 years."

7929,[MKBHD] Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,,9896,2019-10-22 04:20:34,"Another cost on a phone already heavily overpriced, they can just really suck it with their 64 GB of storage. Sure, maybe I can live with it, but I don't see why I would not buy a Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro instead for 400€ and get the same CPU, same RAM, AMOLED screen, 128 GB, better design, in-screen fingerprint, a popup selfie cam, Dual GPS and even a headphone jack. Ah yes and 4000 mAh battery with 27W fast charging.

The camera is not on the same level, but still, it's an IMX586 and there is an ultra wide and zoom lens; it's not bad at all.

I don't care for their Pixel experience at all, they have shown many times that the QA is abysmall. Nowadays MIUI and other third party skins barely introduce more bugs than Google, the battery optimization works with default settings - there are no missed notifications or reloading apps. It's much better than it has been on the S8. 

Animations and gestures are better than stock. Additional features are useful. There is hardly any annoying bloat like some people like to pretend. Especially there are no ads or notifications like that on the global MIUI devices. I don't remember the last time I saw an unexpected notification.

The features I like most are that I can setup a second password that takes me to an otherwise hideable second account on the phone with different apps installed etc. and that via a third party theming app I was able to replace emojis with the iOS ones.

All in all, I just don't see why I would pay double the price for a phone that is worse in many regards and really just got the camera and 90 Hz screen over my phone. Might as well sell mine after a year and get the next generation and still be significantly cheaper than the Pixel. If the Pixel was priced 350€ cheaper I would consider it, for what they are charging they can really forget about me buying it."

They throttle it back to 60hz so much that you almost never see the 90hz display then when you do it’s just jarring. It’s not smooth across the board instead it is smoother or not as smooth and it doesn’t feel quite right. Then they made the batteries small which coupled with a 90hz display is a terrible idea.

I’ve had and enjoyed pretty much all the smartphone operating systems and cell phone production companies. I’m just putting out the truth here. The pixel 4 missed the mark, the iPhone 11 hit it. I have evidence as to why. I don’t see why I may seem like the marketer when the person I was responding to said the pixel was great and futuristic for having a watered down, part time, battery draining 90hz display.

Samsung still offer a lot of extra features in their Android implementation, but now most of those I find are actually useful. From small handy features (like scrolling screenshots, extracting text from what's on screen, multiple Bluetooth outputs, ....); to extra apps (like secure folder, voice recorder, Samsung pay, ...) and stuff like night mode."

If I was you I’d weigh up 7T vs 11, because dealing with those curves day to day could drive you nuts. It’s far more significant than more recent Samsung ones, and more like their earlier attempts (think S6 Edge Plus). If you can live with that, then it’s a great phone, but I honestly think the 7T is the best compromise Android side even with that ridiculous camera bump."
8072,[MKBHD] Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,Prolougey,9896,2019-10-22 10:32:03,"Definitely a dilemma, honestly both look to be great devices so at least you know you can’t make a wrong decision! I have a friend who has the 7 pro and he swears by it and hasn’t had a single issue so I’d imagine the 7t can only be better.

The ecosystem is a strong draw, being able to sync and send iMessage across my laptop is leading me to consider a Mac as my next laptop. 

The big thing that I’m taking away at the moment is how it seems Apple is really listening to the concerns of its users, the 11 really focuses on the things people really want and gives it all at a seriously competitive price: best camera in class, fastest soc in any phone, 5 years of support and  amazing battery life."

But Google really cut a lot of corners this year and turned out something really behind the curve. I guess at least the Pixel is $200 cheaper than the iPhone? I don't know, man."

It requires involvement from everyone from suppliers to the manufacturer. Virtually everything in the device requires securing multi-year contracts with suppliers. Especially so with someone as large as Foxconn on the manufacturing side.

The initial leaks for the iPhone surfaced in around July and the in-hand leaked Pixel 4 models came around September. That would not be nearly enough time for anyone to copy and engineer a device and get a manufacturer to spit out a few copies.

It being square is the next logical evolution of a camera module. One camera? A round thing in the corner. this is obvious, camera lenses are round. Two? You're going to have them as two circles or connected as a rectangle/slot. Three? You're going to have either them in a a line or clustered side-by-side where they'd fit best into a square.

Google trying to introduce a tech that Samsung did back in 2013. - https://youtu.be/Q2TtdM4iI5k?t=24

yes I know Google using SOLI and Samsung using camera sensors, but still the average consumer won't know or care.

battery life.. wow.... I mean Apple got slammed for years for having shitty battery life and they finally decided to upgrade it after getting so much shit. what did google do? join the shitty battery life crowd.

Beating Samsung to the 90Hz display isn't a big deal, again average consumer won't care.

not having free storage... lame.

I'm glad that I stuck with my N10+

seriously, I've started off on Saturday with GPS and BT and throwing a video in the car for my kids to watch, sneaking a few clash royale games when the kids were doing their activity (at the park), using Samsung pay to pay dinner... from 9am to 7pm, my battery still had 43% battery life. The only thing tthat I did do was enable the power save mode to medium. other than that, i'm very happy.

reverse wireless power share, this happened last week at work, co-worker left his phone in his car and it drained down. He had to call his wife (but the battery was dead), so I reversed charged the phone while the entire team were out eating dinner. minutes later, he's got enough juice to call his wife and then charged again to get a tad more juice to GPS home. he made it! :)

I have a 512GB extra storage, I flew (today) and including layover, over 8 hrs. my Note 10+ battery had 35% left and I watched Xmen, StarWars 7, and played 2048.

Not being a Samsung fanboy, I do also own iphone x and pixel 2. I'm not happy with pixel 4. I'm very happy w/ my N10+

don't forget N10+ also has ultrawide. =)"

My wife and son have pixels (2XL). It amazing how they smoke the note 9 in usage and camera. In the Note 10 review, MKBHD noted that Samsung stayed with a 60 fps display; for him that was the big miss of the Note10. The camera situation is interesting: the Note 9 gets very good DxoMark scores but there is no doubt at all that the Pixel 2s we have take better photos in the opinion of the real humans who compare them. 

Mostly, though, I am over  the cognitive load of duplicate apps, primitive gestures and long waits for software updates. The Note 9 is my fourth Samsung in row. The pure Android experience interests me. The Verge review of the P4XL was much more positive, by the way.

My Pixel 2 was below 50% by noon. The battery is stupid efficient. And honestly, I've really come around to liking iOS more. Spotlight is fantastic, it works with zero hiccups, and between iMessage and Airdrop, I can't see going back to Android. My frustrations that caused me to initially leave iPhone (poor battery life, didn't enjoy the OS) are now how I feel with Android (at least the Nexus/Pixel line).

And i'm thinking since i'm getting an iPad I should just buy into the system completely and sync everything seamlessly between the devices, it's just a huge discrepancy with the OnePlus 7T Pro having one of the most beautiful screens i've seen with the 90hz refresh rate, and a camera that's a bit more versatile vs the iPhone 11 with all it's plus points, still looks like a 2017 phone and the screen is certainly better than the specs would let on, but it's still unimpressive. Would love that OP7T Pro hardware with iOS on it.

And yeah, it actually seems like Apple has started listening to its users even more than most android OEM's this year."
8206,[MKBHD] Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,InSummaryOfWhatIAm,9896,2019-10-22 15:46:50,"I have tried iPhone not too long ago, that's the thing. I'm crazy about phones, last year I owned 22 different phones (i'm not rich, just stupid with money and also didn't buy all the phones, did some buying pre-owned, trading, selling) , ranging from all the flagships to cheap chinese beasts and everything in between, and my favorite phone these last two years i THINK, the only ones that didn't give me this itch when the next flagship came out, was the iPhone X and the OnePlus 6T, both of them offer a good software-experience, and the 6T's camera wasn't too great but eh everything else was excellent. I managed to use the Pixel 2, 2 XL, 3 and 3 XL last year too and the 2 XL was cool but the screen was eh (think i got one of the better ones but it still wasn't great), the 3 i loved the form factor on but the battery was kinda garbage, and the 3 XL was really nice and I didn't mind the notch, but I sold it off or traded it with someone. 
I know that if I buy a Samsung (at least the regular phones, i think the Fold would be an exception) I grow tired of the phone after a couple of months, Huawei always makes me think ""damn that's cool"" and then when I play around with the phone I realize how much i hate the software, Xiaomi I like, but not as an ""endgame"" device which is what I want now haha. Pixel is cool, but sometimes i've had the thought that it's an EXCELLENT camera with a slightly subpar phone experience, because Google Assistant sucks if you're not in one of the countries that they've worked most with developing it, or actually it kinda sucks everywhere if you're not from the US. 

I actually really like snapping cool photos but don't like tinkering around with photos too much, would you think the OnePlus 7T Pro isn't for me? Like legit i'm hoping that you're gonna say no because that would make it easier on me. I have no preference for OS, I love Android because I actually like customizing my phone, high screen-to-body-ratio, but it also takes up unnecessary time, and i've come to a period in my life where i'm not sure if I have any actual benefits from being able to customize and having an app drawer etc. 
I LOVED the iPhone X, that's the only phone I came even close to keeping for even a year since 2015-2016?
Also I think I should maybe go with the iPhone 11 Pro, not the Max, and not the regular 11. 
My heart is being tugged in different directions!!! LIKE: 
My wallet wants the iPhone 11 (or tbh a cheap Xiaomi phone but nah)
My heart wants the iPhone 11 Pro because of the small form factor but still being powerful as f00k (my hands aren't that big), and I just like how it feels. 
My BRAIN wants the iPhone 11 Pro Max, because of the battery life and resale value so I can have the behemoth phone now despite it being heavy and unwieldy, and sell it and basically buy the smaller version of the 2020 iPhone basically outright... what's the smartest move? I had the XS Max for a little while late last year or early this year, and it actually felt quite underwhelming compared to other phones around that time, but I think that might've just been because I was getting into ultrawide angle cameras and it lacked that, but I also think that the icons and everything look pretty bad on a big display."

I'm actually saying it's bad that they restrict it so much. They shouldn't. But they know they have to because the battery life is extremely piss poor otherwise.

Most average consumers consider budget to be much lower.

I personally consider the Pixel 3a fairly budget-priced, at least in USD, but the 3a XL not quite as much. Meanwhile if you asked my dad, there's no way he'd agree with me that the 3a is budget because $400 for a phone is a lot.

8384,[MKBHD] Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,Electric_Alpha_Dodo,9896,2019-10-22 13:44:14,"Thanks for your input. I have been debating with myself for probably 3-4 weeks now whether or not I should get the iPhone 11. I currently have a Note 9 and I'm pretty happy with it actually. For me, trying the iPhone would just satisfy my curiosity for iOS, since I never tried an apple product before. Guess it's kind of a 'grass is always greener on the other side' situation.

May I ask you for your honesty opinion: Which phone did you use before the iPhone 11 and can you see any difference in screen quality if you previously used a QHD/OLED device? The only thing that's holding me back at this point is the fear of getting a much lower quality screen than I have in my Note 9. Everything else about the iPhone seems extremely impressive, though. I considered getting a Pro Max but can't quite justify the insane price point. The regular 11 really seems like the one to get this year.

Edit: I did indeed compare the 11 to the 11 Pro and Pro Max, as well as my Note 9. Side-by-side, I could immediately see some differences in screen quality, e.g. a grey-ish tint when displaying white pages in the browser. I also immediately noticed that fine details such as in the Safari icon looked a little bit fuzzy. If you don't have a side-by-side comparison though, do you ever catch yourself thinking 'damn, I wish I had an OLED screen'? Maybe at night in a dark room, or looking at the pictures you took with the device's amazing cameras?

I'm also enjoying the trend of dark themes/dark mode, which obviously look better on OLED screens and come with the additional bonus of saving some battery. How does the iPhone 11 screen look specifically with dark mode enabled?"
8385,[MKBHD] Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,InSummaryOfWhatIAm,9896,2019-10-22 16:22:56,"That's cool to hear! I think the option to choose different colors on the iPhone 11 is GREAT, but also annoying because I lately overthink and overanalyze things, so it's hard for me to make choices. I used to be incredibly impulsive with a lot of choices especially regarding money and it put me in some difficult times, so now i'm the other side of the spectrum instead and want to make the right choice, think an extra time before i pull the trigger on something. I like the purple a lot, and the white is pretty cool but I wish it was even more off-white than it is, like cream/ivory, and i don't like the silver color on the frame. The black is abysmal for how fingerprint-y it gets, the red is not my jam at all (had the XR in red actually and I don't know what I was thinking, i'm not a ""red guy"" at all haha), the yellow surprised me because I don't usually like yellow but it's not my favorite. I haven't seen the green in real life either, and that seems like it could be really cool. 

Also no, i'm definitely a sucker for the ultrawide, I think the only phone I could use without an ultrawide is if it had a SUPERB main lens like the Pixel, and had a secondary telephoto lens, but i'd rather have ultrawide."

400 USD/7.25 USD/Hr = 55.2 hours of work to buy a Pixel 3a at minimum wage

Taxes are higher in Australia, but US healthcare and housing prices are extremely high, so they're still better off.

Oh and wages are very depressed in the US too. The median income (for individual not household) salary is 30k USD/year, or about 15 USD/hour. Meaning our median income is barely higher than Australia's minimum wage when you convert the units.

The honest answer is, the only thing I really notice negatively is true blacks, and even then only at night. The LCD has punchy colours, blacks look great in the daytime, and it gets very bright.

One thing I’m really happy about is I don’t have the black smear I used to get with OLED, which was by far my biggest OLED bug bear. 

As for resolution, I really don’t notice. You could have told me this display is 1080p or 1440p, and I wouldn’t bat an eyelid unless I put the screen right up to my eye. Text is sharp, video looks clear.

It all comes down to preference. A lot of people stick to the true blacks, but the black smear that comes with it is usually a deal breaker for me. I’d wholeheartedly recommend the screen on the 11."

Also side note, I don’t know if you’ve seen the white XR or the white 11, but it seems very much like a cream/ivory mix this year, and I was actually surprised how much less “white” it was compared to the XR. 

The green is quite minty and faded, which some like but isn’t my cup of tea. If I had to rank the colours from favourite to least favourite it would go: Purple, Red, Black, Yellow, Green, White, and I vastly prefer the new white to the old one because of the side rails like you mentioned.

And yeah, coming from the wide/telephoto setup of the XS to this wide/ultrawide setup, I definitely prefer the latter. Digital zoom does the job for the most part but unless you take a dumb photosphere panorama thing for like 15 seconds, there’s no replacement for an ultrawide."

Perhaps you should understand what the facts you've googled mean before posting them. 

Or just apply common sense. 

The $30k wages you are quoting include 16 year old part time workers. Most countries adjust the numbers to assume that those are full time workers; the US doesn't. (There are reasons for doing it either way, but you have to know what number you are dealing with).

US median income for individuals is published quarterly and is easy to find. 

The most recent individual wage number is $47,800.

https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf

The US median income is $62,000.

https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/09/us-median-household-income-up-in-2018-from-2017.html

Note that it's impossible to have a median income of $62k with a median income of $30k.

Australia has insanely high housing. More so than the US.

And all of the photons killed on talking about minimum wage is a waste - only 1% of adults workers make the minimum wage.

While I in theory like Black better than Red, and actually do even in this case, the way that the phone looks like a big smudge after touching the phone once with the black is sort of like an automatic disqualification, lmao. 
Yeah, I REALLY dislike the white on the XR and greatly prefer the 11's White, because on the XR it's just such a dull, FLAT and lifeless white color. I saw the white 11 just earlier today and it's a nicer white, but it's still sort of in a spot where it's not ivory/cream enough to look like they were deliberately going for that color, and not white enough to be just white, it kinda just looks like a white that's just a bit... off, hahah. 

I like the purple, it kinda feels like my type of color, but i'm also kinda scared that it's one that you'll grow tired of, and a color that might be harder finding a buyer for if you're selling it down the line. I wish they had the stainless steel frames for the 11 series too, because I think the frame is where the phone really looks cheap compared to the Pro-series. 

So do you still feel like it was a solid move going from an XS to the 11 despite the inferior screen? I mean it's such a weird thing where it feels like it shouldn't be an upgrade going from the previous year's ""pro"" (i mean it wasn't but it kinda... was, if you compare it with this years lineup) but the better battery, faster processor and better camera definitely means that it is."

The telephoto camera for the ultrawide is another plus for me, and I already had an 18W charger, so the bundled charger with the pro isn’t even an issue for me.

As for the purple, I honestly think you should go for it. I work in a second hand tech store with over 500 branches, and based on XR, you’re really not losing out much depending on colour. The delta for colour alone is like £20 at most here. I think the only colour that really tanked resales was Coral last year, and that was only through swappa/eBay, and I don’t think any of the colours this year are that egregious. 

As for the frames I agree with the stainless steel, but I still vastly prefer Apple’s anodised aluminium to something like the faux steel Samsung uses or whatever Google was doing on the Pixel 3, and it still feels premium enough for me."

(I've had multiple notes and now an S10, and have mostly liked the samsung phones.)  I'd say pixel but at this point that's looking to be a worse train wreck.  Can't stand iOS so that's out.  Maybe moto if they come out with something decent."

The iPhone 11's cameras are Vertically stacked, the Pixel 4's are side-by side. The 11 Pro's camera are in a sort-of triangle arrangement.

The bump on the iPhone 11/Pro is body color, the Pixel 4's are black.

Your criteria effectively boils down to ""The camera is in the corner of the phone, and they didn't put them in a line."" Seriously, ask yourself how they would possible arrange them if they didn't do it the way they did. Encase them in a circle in the corner? Having two drastically contrasting radii would look like shit.

Everything in a row? That is what all the Android makers have been doing so far. Center of the body? Google has never done that with a Pixel. Computational image stacking gets significantly more problematic as distance between them increases and causes a larger parallax error.

Three cameras flush with the body? They obviously wouldn't have been able to do that, or they wouldn't have a need for the bump it currently has.

Four raised bumps for the cameras/sensor/flash? Really?

If there is an obvious design, you're going to have multiple people come to the same conclusions about how it can be designed."

I'm still KINDA thinking I should splurge and get the iPhone 11 Pro because I just love that size, but we'll see. I'm thinking since i'm going to do financing on it, the iPhone 11 Pro is technically too expensive, but I'm thinking I can always have something new if I get that, so i'll sell it and buy the 2020 entry-level iPhone with the A14 chip when it comes out, and then when 2021 rolls around I can start anew on whatever is out then, so I can always have the newest stuff. Think that seems like a solid strategy. But it all depends, we'll see what happens. 
Also think the colors on the Pro models are difficult choice this year, haven't seen Gold irl but it looks boring judging from videos. The Silver is actually more nice than I first thought, saw it for the first time yesterday, and it's a nice perk being able to buff out possible scratches on the frame since it's just stainless steel without any sort of finish on it (my iPhone X in black got a chip in the frame without me dropping it or anything after only a few weeks). The Space Grey and Midnight Green are both so similar despite not actually being that similar. The space grey is stealthy and would probably go better with my style, but the green looks ""cooler"" to me, but it's not a match with anything else I own, which is such a bullshit boring statement but it does feel like it kinda matters haha.

Also, I really do want to buy into the Apple ecosystem, but when I go and check the Galaxy Note 10+ I just feel like it's such a bad move to buy an iPhone 11 for (basically) the same price as something with THAT screen. It's just beautiful, but I get tired of Samsung phones right away usually, it's too lightweight (weird complaint maybe but it makes it feel less premium), and yeah I don't know."

You do realize apple only JUST started putting decent batteries in their phones, right?  I'd bet the percentage of iPhone users who jumped ship over battery life is in the low single digits.  My wife has had iPhones for the past 8 years or so.  Her XR is the first one that had remotely competed with any of the Android phones I've had, in terms of battery life.  And guess what, she's still so trained by the tiny batteries of her old iPhones that she still constantly worries about charging and how much battery she's got left.  If someone likes the brand, the OS, and the image, they'll put up with less than stellar specs. Even at premium prices.

Now something working against Google and the pixel is that they still don't have a bunch of market recognition for the general populace and since they design their phones very similarly to iPhones, people often assume that's what it is.  I agree, the small batteries on a premium phone are stupid. As are the small amounts of memory and hard drives.  But if the P4 fails, it'll come down to price and lack of brand awareness.  Or some fatal defect that turns off the small segment of the market that actually knows and likes the pixel brand.

One other thing people tend to overlook these days when they argue about battery size is the proliferation of quick charging, wireless charging, and just the overall availability of charging stations and cords/outlets.  It's kinda like the electric car range anxiety argument.  Most available electric cars have plenty of range to get most people through most of their days.  But there's a mental aspect to it and they worry about running out of charge and being stuck.  It's just as easy to run out of gas, but gas is cheap, quick, and easy to get.  Electric charging is quickly getting there for most people, but they just aren't used to it yet."

But Apple can't be compared to Android in terms of battery. 

They can stretch a full day out of a battery half the size of an Android. 

Their software/hardware optimization is unrivaled by anyone else. 

They accomplish so much with so little. It's just unfair to do that to Android 😅

I had every generation of iPhone up until the 8, then I just had it with the poor battery life and switched to Android. So I do agree with you to a point, but there are more of us than you think. 

My parents have had all iPhones (per my recommendation) but are also looking to switch because of battery life. 

But, this was the first year I considered switching back because they seemed to match their optimization prowess with larger batteries. 

If Apple ever stuffed a 4000mAh battery into a phone it would last 2 full days. 

There are a lot of Android that would sputter out by noon if they used the specs Apple did.

I'm honestly shocked by this sub (and /r/Android)'s response to the leaks. People seem to really love it. When the design first leaked months ago, people seemed pretty cool to negative on the look. As we've gotten closer, people are loving it more and more. 

I think the Pixel 3 (regular) is the best designed Pixel so far. I definitely miss the personality of the two tone window. This feels like the most iPhone phone design they've ever done. Simple, stark, and premium."

8858,Google Pixel 4 XL hands-on images,mostlikelynotarobot,9895,2019-09-10 04:25:02,why would you need to unlock your phone before looking at it? It's not like you can do anything else at that point.
8859,Google Pixel 4 XL hands-on images,dlerium,9895,2019-09-10 16:05:15,">I'm still not sold on **any** face unlock replacing my fingerprint reader, no matter how good. (Fingerprint reader means I can unlock my phone without it even facing me)

There's pros and cons to both and I suggest you to really use a phone before knocking it. I use an XS Max and Pixel 3 XL so I have used both worlds. I also used older iDevices for work with TouchID so I'm fairly familiar with front sensors too.

* As much as people say the rear fingerprint is natural, it's more natural than TouchID on the home button, but FaceID is WAY more natural. What do I mean by this? For instance when you're using LastPass to copy passwords (because autofill on Android is reliable about 10% of the time compared to iOS), it's noticeable when you have to place your finger on the reader. I'd argue when you're using your phone two handed in a typing or scrolling position, my finger doesn't always rest on the fingerprint reader, so it's a noticeable extra action to place my finger on it. While that isn't a huge deal, it's noticeable when you use FaceID. When Autofill fails on iOS very rarely, I open LastPass and it's completely seamless. I don't need to move a muscle and it authenticates. As someone who switches between the two phones throughout the day, this difference becomes noticeable if for instance I just setup a new app and I want to login on both phones.
* Rear fingerprint sensor means I need to pick up the phone each time. FaceID you can awkwardly hover over it, but both aren't perfect for on-desk use. In this case an in-screen or front sensor actually is the best.
* When driving, because Google neutered OK Google unlocks, I have to reach physically behind the phone on my hands free mount to use it.  I use smart lock in my car for this reason but when I travel for work I don't have the time to setup smart lock for a new car. It's quite annoying. My iPhone authenticates on the hands free mount again with FaceID with no issues.
* As for unlock accuracy, both are pretty solid.  FaceID only fails when I try to use my phone secretly like under the table during a work meeting and the forehead is hidden under the table. Or if I click on an app that requires authentication and then put my phone down before its done authenticating. Again this is rare.
* Yes I recognize you can pull your phone out with a fingerprint sensor and have it unlocked already, but FaceID is pretty fast. I really do think that the average user doesn't care about this 0.2 second differential.
* I'd love to have faceiD + rear fingerprint sensor but I recognize costs are prohibitive."

I might be getting hung up on little things, but I really liked that I could open my phone with the fingerprint reader from any position, even if it was in my pocket, for example if it started ringing and I wanted to quiet it real quick I could fingerprint then volume down without having to take it out and look at it."

Well it's a good thing I specifically said:

> Gonna wait until I can try one in the real world though. 

Ideally, I'd actually have both face recognition and fingerprint recognition. But given the choice between the two, I would far rather have a fingerprint scanner than face unlock. A small subset of the reasons why are:

* I use fingerprint gestures. A lot. I have up/down swipes to get to the navigation bar, but also swiping left replaces my back button and swiping right goes to the last app. I use this every day, and it's more convenient than even the gesture navigation. Face recognition doesn't have this, and while Soli would change the way I use my phone with gestures, these apply in a rather different use case from when I use fingerprint gestures. In fact, they complement each other pretty nicely, as fingerprint navigation is useful for when I'm holding the phone (e.g. walking down the street, on the couch, etc.), whereas touchless navigation is perfect for when I'm not holding the phone. (e.g. driving, phone on a stand, etc.).
* I want a specific action that allows me to authenticate for things like my password manager. It's not necessarily more security, but it allows me to feel comfortable about when I'm actually authenticating to my device.
* Using fingerprint authentication, I can unlock my phone without taking it out of my pocket. This is useful when my device locks but I want to use Google Assistant for more things than it can do while locked.
* Everywhere where my phone is on a stand (car, bedside table, desk), my phone is already unlocked when I place it there and, thanks to having my watch, my car's bluetooth audio, and my bluetooth headphones as trusted devices, remains unlocked. These are the cases where something like Trusted Faces would be useful for me, but that's already a solved problem.

In short, for me fingerprint unlock has a significantly broader set of use cases than face unlock, and unless they're able to come up with workarounds for this, fingerprint unlock is a better option for me."

Samsung Users Cannot Delete Facebook From Their Phones ...

But also the fact that Samsung is bad about updates and supporting new versions of Android in a timely manner.

Pixel is most like the iPhone and that is big for me.  But I came from using iPhones since the 3G.  So getting the iPhone experience but with Android is what I value.   

It is similar in our home.   All phones with my kids are either an iPhone or a Pixel.   None have ever asked for a Samsung phone and would be really surprised if they ever did.  I am in the US and maybe what is different.

Samsung has also been a lot more into gimmicks.   I really prefer the Apple and Google approach.  We also have a lot of other Google and Apple hardware and do not have anything from Samsung."

Google has SOLI, 1 flood illuminator, and 2 IR cams (more tech than apple is packing). The depth of the bezel is the same as the iPhone notch, Google decided that the notch was ugly and decided to cover the whole thing with a bezel. Other than that it looks about the same. This really comes down to notch vs bezel and I'll take the bezel all day every day over the notch. Look at the image I posted."

That's the decryption key that is input by the system to unlock the phone. 

No need for the power button if you picked up the phone in a way like you'd pick it off the table or from a pocket. Screen lights up and by the time you're able to see the time & notifications it's unlocked. If you swipe from the chin of the phone at the same time, all this happens during the animation that slides the lockscreen away and you're at the springboard. You only have to press the power button to confirm the scan for Apple Pay, and to me it just seems like a way more secure way than Android Pay where you just unlock the phone to home screen and it works automatically. 

To silence the call you just click the power button once. No need to ever unlock the phone. Although overall the call experience is so much better on Android, it's a joke - still full-screen that just interrupts whatever you're doing"

9033,Google Pixel 4 XL hands-on images,kdmion,9895,2019-09-10 07:51:01,"1. So let me know if I got this right. You are telling me that somehow while your phone is in a car mount it would be easier to dismount it or reach around the back and authenticate with your finger instead of just using your face to unlock it, correct? 

2. If the phone is sitting on the table, with the current finger print reader setup you would need to pick it up to unlock it, so another point is being invalidated. 

Out of the 3 that you have pointed out, only one scenario is legit, and that's because I have no idea how FaceID works with sunglasses. But a quick Google search, points out that there is a way around that. So none of the points you gave actually validate that finger print is so much better than face unlock."
9034,Google Pixel 4 XL hands-on images,dlerium,9895,2019-09-10 17:47:46,"I get that there are definitely use cases where either could be superior, but my point of trying it and using it extensively is that you can figure out new workflows. I don't think it's ever fair to expect workflows to transfer over to new features. There's always going to have to be some adaptation.

>I use fingerprint gestures. A lot. I have up/down swipes to get to the navigation bar, but also swiping left replaces my back button and swiping right goes to the last app.

Sure but I'd argue when you're actually using your phone like swiping around, the natural position (at least for me) isn't to put the finger on the fingerprint sensor. I think it would make sense if Google just improved overall gesture navigation so that I don't even need the fingerprint sensor. Given how gesture-based iOS is already, I don't miss any fingerprint sensor gestures at all. My hands stay in the exact same position as I'm using the phone.

>Using fingerprint authentication, I can unlock my phone without taking it out of my pocket. This is useful when my device locks but I want to use Google Assistant for more things than it can do while locked.

I hear this a lot, but I have yet to see a case where I felt like I missed out on something because I was not able to unlock my XS Max in my pocket while I was able to in my Pixel 3 XL. No offense but I tend to think that this is something the mass market won't really care about.

As for Google Assistant, I feel the decision to neuter Assistant and require an unlock really set the capability of devices backwards. In iOS you can ask to navigate home or navigate anywhere without an unlock. The difference is that iOS locks you in that app and you can't go home and get full access to the phone. I'm guessing Google didn't create an API or sandbox for Assistant to work in so that if you ever launch a 3rd party app through Assistant (try on an older device than a Pixel 3 for instance), then you can simply press home and get full access to the phone. To me, the problem is more about Google Assistant getting neutered and not having a good solution to address it.

With that said I really think consumers shouldn't hold back on buying this solely because of the change from fingerprint to faceid. Without a doubt no transition will be perfect, but I think for the most part the usability will be comparable. For some it will be better and for others it will be worse."

I buy my kids whatever phone they ask for and never even mentioned Samsung.   It is Google or Apple.

Really for all our hardware.   We have Google homes in most rooms of our house.   We replaced our airport extremes with Google WiFi.   Another product Google just nailed

I replaced my Mac Book pro used for development with a Pixel Book.

Same with services.   We now have YouTube TV which is probably the best product ever from Google.

My wife recently replaced her iPad with a Pixel Slate.  Which she loves.   

Apple and Google can cover pretty much everything and we have had great experience with both.   Think be a step down to use Samsung.

This is purely conjecture at this point. The flood illuminator projects IR dots and the IR cameras read them, they kind of go hand in hand. While I agree that the finger print is fine and more than good enough the face unlock isn't just used to unlock phones. It also allows facial tracking and movement that enable other features than enable augmented reality tech. I agree, fingerprint is nice but I think moving forward the face unlock tech gives us security + a bunch of other augmented reality functionality that the finger print can't provide.

You know what you get if you buy a Samsung? 99% of the software with a much MUCH better hardware. 

It's a premium fucking phone, why would you ""settle"" for a totally inferior hardware?"
9161,The Google Pixel 4 XL Review: Stuck In The Past In 2019,stipo42,9895,2019-11-09 03:46:04,"You know what, something needs to change with the phone market. I've been team Android all the way. I moved to Google fi for two reasons, my bills would be way less, and I got the promise of a nearly clean Android experience.

I had the Moto Nexus 5x which was an awesome phone with an unfortunate design flaw. Then I moved to the pixel reluctantly, it was the most money I'd ever paid for a phone ($650). The Nexus 5x was like $300 or so when I bought it, which I already thought was crazy. Both phones offered nearly the same experience.

Now with Android 10 I feel like the operating system has peaked as a phone os.
I'm not sure what else I would want. The UI is great, and snappy. 

I guess I'm a casual user though, I rarely snap pictures or video if it's not in snap chat.

This week I bought the pixel 3a xl. The 4 didn't even appeal to me, especially at it's price tag. 

I upgraded not for new features but because my battery was showing it's age (near 20% at the end of the day with light usage), and Google dropped security patch support for the phone this month. 

I didn't even think the 3 was a good deal. I find it crazy that people pay this much for phones, and then upgrade within a year, paying just as much for such small upgrades. (Isn't the new iPhone like 1200 now?)

If my pixel had a swappable battery, I would have gladly kept using it without security updates for a while, maybe thrown a different distribution on there (are there any active ones anymore? The stock Android experience has been great so I've lost track of the custom scene)"
9162,The Google Pixel 4 XL Review: Stuck In The Past In 2019,Omega192,9895,2019-11-08 18:07:04,"I was glad to finally see some battery benchmarks with each display mode to compare apples to apples with the OP7Pro

>Overall, the Pixel 4 XL’s battery life isn’t very competitive. It’s amongst the worst results we’ve had for a 2019 device. I have to be accountable to myself here as whilst the phone has worse battery life than the OP7Pro, it’s not *that* much worse. Having said that the OP7Pro battery life was still completely useable, the Pixel 4 XL is also still very useable as it is. The problem again is that the Pixel came 6 months later, and in the face of a new iPhone generation which brought immense leaps in battery life, the Pixel 4 XL doesn’t seem to be that wise a purchase.

So the XL is pretty close to the OP7Pro yet people seem to act like it's ~~complete trash~~ just ""okay"". Interesting. Shame the regular 4 would have even worse battery life but had I wanted to upgrade I'd probably just keep it on 60Hz and get similar life to my P3. If older iPhones are anything to go off of, the average users don't consider battery life as much of a life or death situation as this sub.

That being said, they surely had to get some sort of a deal on the smaller battery cause there's no other reason to shrink it from the previous gen while also adding 90Hz. Hopefully all the well-deserved criticism is acknowledged and addressed.

Also  Soli is responsible for controlling the AOD as well. If you walk away from your phone it turns AOD off, but back on when you approach. That's the kinda subtle nicety that I enjoy. Sure, motion sense isn't some groundbreaking feature, but sometimes it's the little things that add up to a nice experience. I've found myself wishing for the alarm ducking feature when I reach for my phone in the morning."

Android was so exciting, with monster phones like the HTC HD2 was it? And so on basically. Then Google started taking a much more sterner grip on Android and I started to get frustrated with the lack of a cohesive feeling with their apps, especially on the UI front. I still remained with android owning a 6P and Pixel C, until the latter died 1yr after ownership and was replaced by an iPad Pro - only then had I realised how far Apple was ahead of the game.

Yesterday I purchased an iPhone Xs second hand for £610 and await delivery. I had been waiting for the Pixel 4 to be the one device to change my mind about Google's 'direction' and I realised they still haven't any. Apple are just doing everything right, for a hefty price."

They clearly make nice phones, their hardware is excellent. The only thing they're lacking to put Google out of the phone business is a naked, bloat-free Android experience. 

The number of people, myself included, on here that I've seen considering iPhone over Google after this latest release is staggering. People who want pixels want a true, uncluttered, immediate update, raw Android experience. They don't want to be sold on ""Bigsby"" which sounded like gimmick the second it existed. So if Google is failing on hardware, we're going to head to the mothership of excellent hardware, Apple, even if that means forsaking the superior ecosystem. 

I can't imagine why Samsung doesn't step up with a Note 10 that operates just like a Pixel. Who wouldn't jump ship to that platform?"
9211,The Google Pixel 4 XL Review: Stuck In The Past In 2019,,9895,2019-11-09 04:23:33,"Honestly, I don't get it. The battery is not great, but everything else seems fine.

The competition has gotten better with cameras, but I still prefer the Pixel's processing. Motion Sense looks useful, face unlocking is nice to have, and fast wireless charging is now present. It looks great, the telephoto seems good, and it's one of the few phones that has 90 Hz. Even with less RAM and a ""regular"" 855, others have reported [fantastic Android performance](https://youtu.be/PkVW5eSXKfw). To say nothing of day 1 updates, guaranteed monthly security patches, and exclusive Pixel features like call screening, Now Playing, squeeze for Assistant, and Recorder transcription.

Are these *really* worth nothing? Sure, OnePlus might have 90 Hz on more often, but it can get in the way (see games like Pokemon Go). Sure, triple cameras are nice, but there's usually a lot of color shifting and horrendous low light performance with them. Sure, Samsung and OnePlus have nice extras, but they often feel at odds with the rest of the OS. Especially when it comes to small things like design details.

I'm debating between a Note 10 and Pixel 4 XL, but there's so much craziness surrounding the Pixel 4 that I find it hard to know what information to take."

They do.

>they don’t have the best night shots,

They haven't for almost a year. People just don't know because they watch reviewers blindly, forgetting that the Huawei P30 completely outdid Google here early this year and is still the best. But American reviewers have decided to ""forget"" it, only comparing night shots of the Pixel 4 with the iPhone 11, and earlier the iPhone 11 with the Pixel 3. The Verge, for example did this, despite writing in their P30 Pro review that its Night Mode ran circles around the Pixel 3.

>The Pixel camera quality meme is finally dead. It’s nothing special now.

Well it is, though. Its consistency in taking great picture is still there. Its superiority in still photos, due to its really well HDR is still there -- even iPhone doesn't win there. Where they falter and others win, is in versatility. The others have rear wide cameras or great video cameras, as well. They supporter higher resolution, higher frame rates, more options and alternatives. This clearly helps them becoming more interesting alternatives. And for some they also win in various still photo areas, like night shots (Huawei most clearly, followed by Apple). 

This is why Google's camera isn't considered the best overall. But in still photos they still are reigning champions from my anecdotal experience, but also from the photo stocks and conclusions of reviewers. However, their superiority is not as big as it used to be; other OEMs have closed the gap some, as Google hasn't really improved its still photo quality that much past 2 years, and done fuck-all to improve other places.

That's what happens when you use the same rear camera sensor for the third consecutive year (Pixel 2, 3 and 4 all use the same sensor). A sensor that by now can only be found in mid-range phones...


[Signed distraught long-time Pixel user who is tired of all the bullshit by Google, and finally abandoning them and their Pixel line-up. Their camera superiority is not as large as before, nor is their software smoothness and consistency. Their major hardware shortcomings, however, are, and they still provide bloodthirsty prices for this ""cheap"" package. Done with this company and buying some specced out 90Hz Chinese phone for $400 instead, and installing Lineage OS for the software experience.]"

That's putting it lightly. 


It should have dealt with the black crush last year. And the year before it.  Didn't.

It should have provided brightness level equal to other OEMs with third-party OLEDs (meaning ~600 nits). Didn't.

It should have gone with Samsung OLED on both units (rather than keeping with cheap LG OLEDs on the smaller one), and provided same calibration treatment for both units. Didn't.


It should have given us more than mediocre (on the big) to shit (on the small) battery life last year (every single Pixel generation has been like that, actual). Didn't.


It should have finally given proper specifications worthy of its price tag, like 128GB base storage, or 8GB of RAM at the very least. Didn't.


It should have finally provided something at least worthy of a flagship design, rather than being worse than their competitors' mid-range units (Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi) in that regard. Didn't.


It should have reduced its price tag considering its shortcomings. Didn't.


It should have fixed the video camera inferiority. Didn't.


As a long-time Pixel user, who has naively bought every unit for the superior software smoothness and consistency, going through multiple RMAs due to QC issues, trusting and hoping that Google fix many of its stupid problems, I'm done getting completely neglected by a company that clearly does not give a fuck. This company is absolutely atrocious in making hardware, doing only well, in fact fantastic, in cheap units (Chromecast, Home Mini, Pixel 3a, Nexus 5, Nexus 7), and are also pretty terrible in software. They have fantastic software in various respects, but are completely neglecting in others (many of their display issues, for example, are negligence of software). 

Yeah, fuck this. I was genuinely excited when hearing about the Pixel 4 having 90Hz, knowing the game-changing feature it was for phones. But they managed to fuck even that up -- not to mention the battery life is so, so bad. Yeah...no. Probably just buying the Realme X2 Pro (basically a OnePlus 7 Pro, but with a headphone jack, for $400) and installing LineAgeOS. Either that or the S11e, if it has 90Hz -- the latter's smoothness will more than make up for Samsung's UI problems). Buying a Pixel 4 at this point is just pure stupidity by me. No interest to keep rewarding someone who keeps spitting in my face."

All of them had cameras which were miles ahead of the competition while making sacrifices elsewhere. Unlimited original photos just sweeted the deal.

You don't get a lot of wasted space with menus and notifications like you do with Samsung One UI, you don't get those excessive round corners everywhere (I do not like that) and you do not get redundant apps like Samsung's own apps or Facebook (Facebook is not removable on US versions of Samsung S9 which use carrier free firmware) and Google's dialer is much better because it has Google's spam call filter and also the call screening. I wish Google would sell their own version of Samsung devices which would use their version of OS, this would be best of both worlds."

Notice how the first phone choice of many disappointed Pixel users is an iPhone. Samsung S9 and up takes almost the same quality video (4k@60) and with the Gcam port, it's got better (most likely subjective, but i've had iPhone 11 Pro Max users tell me they prefer my gcam pics) photos than the 11 Pro Max, but because it's skinned, Pixel users would rather *jump* iOSes, which leads me to believe that one line I read was correct: that Pixel users are just iPhone lovers who are in denial.

>In Display settings, you have the option to choose between the 60Hz and 90Hz refresh rates, but the 90Hz mode actually [changes to 60Hz](https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-7-pro-usb-pd-hdmi-variable-refresh-rate/) for videos, the camera app, and phone calls. Furthermore, Redditors on /r/OnePlus [discovered](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/bvihgq/oneplus_7_pro_changes_to_60hz_when_using_another/eppgotw/) that not every web browser runs in 90Hz, suggesting that there could be an internal whitelist of some sort.

Anyone who buys at launch is paying the early adopter tax and has no one to blame but themselves. That's why companies set the prices they do, it has next to nothing to do with the cost of materials or manufacturing. Last I heard you can get 200-400 off for black friday. That's exactly what I did last year and 600 for the 3 was a steal in my eyes.

Also outside this sub people don't care so much about on-paper specs, they care about the overall experience. I've been plenty happy with the experience on the P3 even though it only has one camera, ""not enough"" RAM, and *only* 64GB of storage. I've yet to fill up the storage since I mostly stream, the one camera is enough for me, and I've had Waze navigating, SoundCloud streaming, and then took pictures and only once or twice did SC get killed.

I think I'm an outlier on this sub as I purposely try to keep the amount of time I spend staring at my phone to a minimum so that's never been a useful metric for me.

Regarding your last point, I said it to another reply, but the biggest mistake I think some of the vocal members of this sub make is assuming what *they* want out of a phone, everyone does.

No, it's not.  Google do some software fantastic, but much of it is also pretty bad, and they in no way deserve to be praised for being a ""software company"" that only do bad in hardware. This is giving them too much credit.

If Google is a ""software company"", how come:


* their gamma calibration has been shit for several years (and continues with Pixel 4 at lower brightnesses)? How come they have not used any serious software mitigations to improve black smear all these years? Not used used any available software tools to improve touch latency?

* they half-arsed their gesture implementation, spending an entire year before managing to make it at the very least acceptable, compared to what existed before (even the immediate alternative implementations of many other OEMS was better)?


*  they can't do RAM management properly? Pixel 3 with 4GB actually kept less apps in memory than other 4GB Android phones (even the older Pixel OG was better!)? This is still true today; their RAM management is not better than other Android OEMs -- let alone anywhere close to Apple, a ""hardware company"". 


* their battery management (battery life compared to battery size) is no better than other OEMs -- but [actually worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dl0azn/the_verge_pixel_4_review_the_best_android/f4n7rda/)? And this is even after they underclock the SoCs noticeably below the standard for the rest of the industry, which they happen to do almost every year. 


*  they couldn't implement the 3XL notch into their UI properly, with various UI elements treating the phone as if there was no notch at various points (even several of their own apps had no notch support properly put in)?


* the software that came with the Pixel Slate last year was absolute garbage, being completely incomplete, full of bugs and being badly designed (the Tablet mode was in 30 FPS out of the box -- in 2018 in a $1000 device!)? Why is ChromeOS, that it uses, still buggy in many areas, and why has it taken so many years for many of the issues, like bluetooth, to finally be resolved?


Google do hardware absolutely shitty (in specification, in design, in build quality and in QC -- all taking price tag into account, naturally). But their software is also full of so many issues and shortcomings. The software from Google is a mixed bag, and the examples above, all cases that should be resolved by any reputable company, proves that. This myth of them being fantastic in software needs to die."
9600,The Google Pixel 4 XL Review: Stuck In The Past In 2019,sandspiegel,9895,2019-11-08 23:24:32,Yeah they had and still have a great camera but the problem for them is that by now the competition also have great cameras.

Why wait 7 months for a Pixel 4 when an S10 is out, has better specs, and has already had a price drop or two? Or better yet, wait 3 months and the first next gen phone will be available.

It's just an awkward time because current gen phones are no longer exciting, they're old and people are getting curious about next gen phones that are already leaking.

Google could get away with tired specs if they at least matched the specs of 7 month old phones and provided something new and exciting on the hardware front, but instead they deliver worse storage and RAM specs, and a hardware design that is 2 generations out of date."

Debatable. Unlike Google, Samsung actually implements dark mode on all their apps. Animations is something that's intentional, so some find it better on Samsung. Also I have a feeling you aren't using One UI.

This isn't even true lol. Pixel is not fluid as Galaxy in performance see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/b0r89a/samsung_galaxy_vs_google_pixel_in_depth/).

If you average the 60Hz (for apples to apples on refresh rate) for the P4XL you get (9.37+10.51)/2 = 9.94

Then for the Mi 9 it's (9.63+9.08)/2 = 9.335

So yeah pretty similar, but you still have to remember the P4XL has a lot more pixels to light up. Plus when you look at the forced 90 Hz it's (8.23+9.71)/2 = 8.97 so only a little less in a ""worst case"" scenario. If anything this has convinced me the P4XL battery is more than just ""okay""."

That's one thing people don't seem to take into account. Google has to step around all these toes and try to not step ON them in order to keep them happy, and especially so for a big Company like Samsung who could put in a little work and transition away from Android IF they wanted.

Combine that with the fact that it would just be hard to get any attention against other big Android manufacturers all releasing around that time, and those manufacturers tend to not announce during the Apple Fall anyway, and the new Android versions that ship with each new phone don't release until around August/September, so it seems like a nice spot to release to me, to placate their partners and compete in mindshare with the biggest phone."

It's easy to forget what Google is good at when we take it for granted so much, that we only notice what they're not good at. 

One user on Reddit a while ago put it succinctly **""It stands out when Google assistant doesn't work, and it stands out when Apple Siri does work...""**

For a company that likes to take ""moonshots"", it's at least encouraging that Google takes so many risks, because it has the resources to take multiple shots at ideas that may pay off. 

While Google may not handle those successes well in some cases, on the whole they have given us many products and services, for free no less, that have become staples of our daily lives.

One telling observation that Google has such successful products, is the fact while Apple have excellent hardware in the iPhone, and mobile OS with iOS, many Apple users mostly use Google products for search, maps, etc daily instead of the Apple-provided native options.

If Google weren't good at software, why are Google products used by so many for their basic needs from Email, Search, Maps, video content, assistant, Documents, browser, etc ?

Here's a list of most popular Application used on Apple mobiles, according to Apple themselves :

https://mashable.com/article/apple-most-popular-iphone-apps-2018/

Notice how none of them are by Apple, many are from Google, including THE most used app on Apple mobiles ?

If Google isn't so good at software, then why are most Apple, and Android, users using Google so much ?"

I generally give Google benefit of the doubt in areas i criticize them for, so as to at least be moderate enough to avoid fanboy backlash and have something to lean on when people try to nitpick. There's for example lots of issues I had on my Pixel 2 and 3 units that I never mention, due to them not being reported as widespread QC issues."
9816,The Google Pixel 4 XL Review: Stuck In The Past In 2019,Kurger-Bing,9895,2019-11-09 23:46:19,"> Begins to list hardware related software issues instead of pure software problems.

You are yourself admitting that they are ""software issues"", so I don't get your point. If Pixel UI turned out less smooth than, say, TouchWiz, would you also excuse any criticism by ""but that's a hardware-related software issue"", because it also relates to the SoC? That's absurd.

The point is, as very clearly demonstrated, that although many of the issues have hardware methods/tools to improve them, they also have many software methods. And Google has done little to deal with the latter. I consciously made those points as a counter to the general excuse Google gets in providing lacklustre hardware, often by the argument that Google fix hardware shortcomings with its excellent software (like the fanboys predicting Pixel 3 would not suffer from 4GB RAM, as Google probably had optimized it). 

People want Google to provide more RAM, they want them to provide larger battery sizes, so on and so forth. But they don't, and  it's often excused by them, and their apologetics, that Google's software approach makes up for it.

I consciously chose points where good results is a bare minimum for a supposedly excellent ""software company"". Calibration (including gamma), for example, is dealt pretty well by company not exactly famous for their software excellence, like OnePlus and Samsung. Hell, even ASUS, a completely unimportant actor in the smartphone scene, did a much greater job here with their ROG Phone 2.

As for black smear, there's software tools like rolling shutter and black frame insertion. For a supposedly impressive software company, Google have been completely absent in doing anything here. This is true in relation to touch latency as well -- Apple have been doing this for a decade, for example. HTC did it pretty excellently for their One flagships for a long time."

The only reason to stay on Android at this point is customizability, and I don't care about that anymore i just want a phone that's enjoyable to use and performs well, that I can do all the things I need to do on it. iPhone does that at this point, the android phones I'm seeing most of the time do not.

>	Thanks to incredibly fast camera sensors, iPhone 11 Pro is able to produce 120 frames per second, alternating between standard exposure and short exposure frames.

The image signal processor and video encoders analyze each of those frames in the moment to capture as much detail as possible. To take it even further, the Neural Engine uses real-time machine learning to optimize the different components of the scene. For example, it might relight the person in the foreground, while reducing noise and enhancing color in the sky. It all happens instantly and automatically.

Apple tends to either not release features that are half baked, or if one slips through the cracks and doesn't work out, it's sent out to pasture. They also find ways to make sure each feature fits into a real life story that may optionally be improved (definitely not degraded) by adding other Apple products.

On Android, features tend to get released in an incomplete state, and then are dual maintained with their partial replacements, which then get partially replaced with the next big idea, year over year.  And features on Android usually help with some steps toward a larger task, but for the other steps, well you figure it out.  And the ecosystem within which an Android phone exists doesn't really extend to include any other device beyond the fact that all devices have an interface to Google services.  But literally all devices with a browser have an interface to Google services so.  I dunno.  Android isn't really positioned as a complete platform.

Tldr: Android features usually leave you trying to understand how you'd use them.  They end up having to market features and metrics.  Apple devices and software intentionally help you do things.  To market them, they just have to show someone doing some real thing...with the help of their Apple Watch, Airpods, iPad, iPhone and MacBook.

And all that said, I still prefer Android because I like the toolbox that is Android, and all of the ways apps can enhance and customize it, and the way that they make progress by improving all of these micro-features at different velocities.  But...Apple's actually got their shit together."

I hear this all the time, but I don't have issues with my Android phone. Assistant is way better than my siri. The thing I probably use the most is the ""share"" feature in the Android ecosystem to send stuff to friends and family and it works way better than iphone. 

Anytime I have an address on my screen, it's really easy to just hit it and choose what I want to do with it. Open it in google maps? Send to my Tesla to set a navigation course? Send to a friend? Android just does it way better. 

Heck, they just updated it on chrome. Now if I long press a image, it'll ask me to send the picture or send a link of the picture.

Not in our scenario it isn't. Google's two strongest points with their phones is software performance (which is related to APIs) and software processing of cameras. Both of those fall well under the definition of ""hardware related software"", a subsection you've decided to create for yourself. It has always been about that from the very beginning. The guy I responded to even said ""They had a good camera, **but it was the software that made the difference. Google is a software company and I guess it shows.**""

It's in that exact same context people relate to Google as a ""software-company"", in terms of what it manages to push out of ""mediocre hardware"" (that it relates to their pure software development as well is also true, but people generally don't make a distinction between them in their description). Even more so when the qualifications I provide almost exclusively are minimum requirements for any premium device to provide, like good calibration, making your criticism to begin with pretty stupid."
9915,The Google Pixel 4 XL Review: Stuck In The Past In 2019,,9895,2019-11-12 19:27:26,"Specifically with the Note 9, I absolutely love it. It's the best Android phone I've ever owned, nothing but good things to say about it. It's just that I'm falling out of love with Android as a whole. 

1. I want exceptional camera quality, which even with Gcam I can't get outside of the Pixel. But the camera is the only thing the Pixel does exceptionally well.
2. I don't care about customization that iPhone doesn't offer and Android does, and Apple added the ability to remove default apps from the homescreen, so it doesn't have to look as cluttered as it used to. I don't care about themes, live wallpapers, or any of those kinds of things that makes Android great.
3. More than anything, I want great performance and optimization, the latter of which Android will probably never get right (seeing as they can't even keep the Pixel optimized for long), and the former of which is about a full generation ahead on iOS.
4. iMessage. Enough said really, but I refuse to wait around for RCS to be implemented in a way that makes sense, in a way where everyone on Android uses it. Most of my friends have and use iMessage exclusively, which makes it a huge feature for me that I'll have to wait around for 5-10 years potentially for Googles implementation (forget about the time it will take for Apple to support it if they ever do).

TL;DR I still believe Android is objectively the better OS. Personally though, I don't care about the things that make it better as much as I did when I was 16. If another Android phone blows me away, I'm sure I'll be back to Android when that happens. But Apple has made enough changes to win me over, and Android has not kept up with the things that (now) mean the most to me.

I love my Note 9 as well, I've thoroughly enjoyed using it (it'll be 2 years by the time I switch to iPhone), it's the best Android phone I've ever owned, I would recommend it to anyone who prefers Android

No, it's just ONE of many examples. I also referred to software performance, which includes a bunch of aspects of the OS, which is also directly related to the hardware, like the SOC. You conveniently forgot about that, just like you've conveniently forgot about all other hardware-software-related aspects of the phone or any other hardware product they make. 

>. It’s not that hard to understand. It’s really that simple. 

There is nothing to understand. Google is providing shit hardware, and is not making up for it with acceptable software implementation here. The ""just because they do good here doesn't mean"" isn't an excuse. At all. All of the points I made are 100% legitimate criticisms, and they all relate to software proficiency, which is included in peoples' use of ""software company"" description of the company. It was in this context the discussion was, and is in this context in other discussions are as well. Google makes a lot of hardware products, and much of their software development is related directly to that -- no matter how much you like to pretend it's of little significance. 

>. I’m going to say it again Google got the software for the camera hardware right but it doesn’t mean all other hardware related software is going to be done well. 

I'm going to say it again. The software separation you have created is your own making entirely. Furthermore, Google also worked on the software performance on many levels, in everything from speed to frame timing consistency to animations to various API solutions, right. Google did AI through a mix of their Visual  Core and the software. They did Soli, and its relation with Face-ID, through software as well. And so on and so forth. And they have products like Home Mini and Chromecast, which are hugely successful and famous for being a great mix of hardware and good software solutions. 

>doesn’t mean all other hardware related software is going to be done well. 

Then Google isn't really a good software company, proving my point. 

>You literally did not prove anything

There was never anything to prove. I gave a perfect case for why Google doesn't deserve to be called a ""software company"", at least in a positive light, as they shortcoming in many ways. You, who for some reason decided he wanted argue for no reason, started bitching about how my examples did not relate to software when they so clearly do. No matter how much you try to deter from this fact, or that many of my points are minimal requirements that any company demanding a premium price should achieve, it does not change that fact."
9965,The Google Pixel 4 XL Review: Stuck In The Past In 2019,cttttt,9895,2019-11-09 10:07:30,"Good question.

I find that at least on Android, notifications are pretty unreliable and less useful than in other apps.  For example, when they do get through, tapping them seldom focuses the message that caused the notification.

Also, often, tapping a notification focuses the right conversation, but the conversation doesn't refresh to include all new messages so I have to notice this and mess around to get it to refresh.  By the time I do this, I usually lose track of which of my unread conversations it was.

As well, Android recently started supporting persistent conversations in notifications...it sucks that Slack is lightyears away from even beginning to support something like this as it would make it way easier to follow multiple threads or direct messages (convos where every message triggers a notification).  Right now, focusing Slack or replying from within a Slack notification dismisses all Slack notifications.  So I gotta remember the new notifications before interacting with them for fear of losing hints on what all the contexts were. The behavior of Hangouts and Messages is very good in comparison here...in these apps, replying from within a notification maintains the entire history of the in-context conversation so I can return to the notification and see what the convo was without even returning to the app.

Also the back button behavior in Slack is amongst the worst in Android.  I like how on PC, you can hit CTRL+[ and CTRL+] to move down and up through the stack of recent conversations.  On Android, it's never predictable what the back button will do or whether it'll quit Slack entirely.  An improved Activity view within the app that additionally includes redacted DMs (like clues on which DMs I was recently participating in across all devices) would be handy here.  Also handy would be the ability to simply swipe left and right through the recent notification stack like on PC.

Also, the list of recent conversations isn't reliably synced between PC and mobile, so sometimes I send a message on PC, eg, ""I gotta go...will let you know on the way to the train station,"" then when I'm on the go, the person I previously messaged on PC doesn't appear in the sidebar on mobile...sometimes, if it's been a long day, I have to wait until they message me to remember who I was chatting with...or I have to open my laptop to just continue the already open conversation there.

This all comes together to make it difficult to follow multiple conversations on mobile.  Because of the reliability of message syncing and notifications even following single conversations is problematic unless Slack is foregrounded and I'm actively watching a convo unfold."
9966,The Google Pixel 4 XL Review: Stuck In The Past In 2019,mjsxii,9895,2019-11-09 01:52:22,"but the slack app is def not based off the IOS design, its just a shit app on Android and the iOS version is LIGHTYEARS ahead. TBH its pretty sad since its from such a prolific tech company."

Here's a quote directly from Apple:

""Thanks to incredibly fast camera sensors, iPhone 11 Pro is able to produce 120 frames per second, alternating between standard exposure and short exposure frames.

The image signal processor and video encoders analyze each of those frames in the moment to capture as much detail as possible. To take it even further, the Neural Engine uses real-time machine learning to optimize the different components of the scene. For example, it might relight the person in the foreground, while reducing noise and enhancing color in the sky. It all happens instantly and automatically.""

They call it extended dynamic range.

You know Samsung software is literally just slapped on top of stock Android right? There's nothing buggy or halfass implemented, now you're just making up shit. 

It's not about brand; if it was, more people probably recognize Samsung than Google phones branding anyways. A lot of people don't care for Samsung skins, phone shapes, and tons of pre-loaded Samsung software (bloatware) and just want Android.

10084,Google Pixel 4 XL hands-on images : GooglePixel,dinofan01,9895,2019-09-10 04:36:43,I hated the notch because what it did to the display. That giant notch meant the notification bar was massive. It was a waste of space in terms of function and it was ugly. And what was in that giant notch? two cameras and a speaker. Other manufacturers were able to put the same amount of function in less space. I'm okay with a notch or bezel if the functions justify it. Pixel 3XL didn't. The 4 seems like it's justifying it. Two cameras and multiple other sensors for project soli. So the screen isn't being affected and there's actual tech in that bezel. I'm okay with that. It's still to be decided whether that function is worth it though. For all we know all those sensors for Project soli might suck and not be worth it. But the idea at least seems nice.

Just saying now with almost no Android oems especially the big 2 in Google and Samsung ending support for the jack in their flagships and in most cases ending SD card support they're basically using Apple business practices so what makes them different now?  Literally just the OS.

It's ironic and embarrassing having supported both Google and Samsung only to see them diss Apple for the same things they're doing now lol.

This is coming from someone who's had a Nexus one, Nexus s, Nexus 6p, S7-10, etc.

The gap in features hardware wise is so thin now, it just comes down to OS differences which as you agreed aren't much different since Apple is copying those features like dark mode etc.

No you don't. Because the height of the notch is determined by the height of the components within it. Turning it into a bezel wouldn't make the forehead any smaller, even on the pixel 3. You never lose screen space going with a notch over a bezel.
