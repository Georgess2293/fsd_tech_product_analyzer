Also,

In addition to these general advantages, Snapdragon chips also have a number of specific features that make them more attractive to consumers, such as:

• Better support for 5G: Snapdragon chips offer better support for 5G networks than Exynos chips. This means that devices powered by Snapdragon chips will be able to take advantage of the latest 5G speeds and features.

• Better AI performance: Snapdragon chips offer better AI performance than Exynos chips. This means that devices powered by Snapdragon chips will be able to run AI-powered apps and features more smoothly and efficiently.

• Better camera performance: Snapdragon chips offer better camera performance than Exynos chips. This means that devices powered by Snapdragon chips will be able to take better photos and videos, especially in low-light conditions.

Overall, Snapdragon chips are still generally considered to be better than Exynos chips.",Neutral

Snapdragon chips are generally considered to be better than Exynos chips for a number of reasons, including:

• Performance: Snapdragon chips typically offer better performance than Exynos chips, both in terms of CPU and GPU performance. This is likely due to the fact that Qualcomm has more experience designing and manufacturing high-performance chips.

• Efficiency: Snapdragon chips are also generally more efficient than Exynos chips, meaning that they consume less power while delivering the same level of performance. This can lead to improved battery life for devices powered by Snapdragon chips.

• Compatibility: Snapdragon chips are more widely compatible with Android devices than Exynos chips. This means that you're more likely to find a device that you want to buy that is powered by a Snapdragon chip.

Yes, I agree with the people before me.
This phone heats up a lot even with just regular or even very light useage. I couldn't figure it out how to make this situation better.
Even on battery saving mode with 70% cpu usage it still heats up quite a lot and the battery life is very poor.
Other than this I like this phone so much, its perfect.

But the battery life is poor so don't buy it if you expect all day battery life. I hope this can be improved with software updates or something. At least Samsung could admit there is a heating issue with this phone, because this is definitely not right.

Go for the S21 FE much better in every aspect compared to the A54.
Yes, I've got the A54, now I cry not have taken a Galaxy S21 FE. I'll return my A54, i don't see improvement from my A53 (a bit better smooth UI, but I prefered A53 pictures...)

But A54 is always ~350 in europe, whereas Galaxy S21 FE tend to disappear from regular supplier, are are ~500 and exynos only here. A significant price different in price for many people like me even I could afford it.

also Galaxy S21 FE slimer, lighter, while still 6.4' display.

A drawback of Galaxy S21 FE is battery life, on web, which is my big use anyway.

So Galaxy S21 FE is not a perfect phone for me either. Onverall a better phone than A54, for sure.",Neutral

I would go for the S21 FE 6GB RAM instead of Pixel 7 8GB RAM but I am scared about that RAM difference.

This phone is still a great buy even in late 2023. For around 400 Euros you get:

- A top notch 120Hz AMOLED
- 2021 Flagship performance (still faster than most midrange phones even with the Exynos version)
- Solid cameras with a dedicated Telephoto lens
- Gorilla Glass Victus protection
- USB 3.2 with Samsung DeX

I have the exynos model on the fe but its still miles better in performance, heating and battery. Other than that the cameras are a significant upgrade too, the output from all sensors and modes, be it portrait or video or night is way bettter, and mainly the zoom as its optical and not hybrid. The display is not necessarily a downgrade, im not a fan of curved displays and i never used the 1440p option anyways so it comes down to personal preference.

Based on videos I have seen the S21 FE is better than the A54 in terms of less wobble effect when taking video, more details and less noise when zooming in on subjects, better portrait shots and better noise reduction. Then again I could be wrong.
I am geared currently towards the Redmi Note 12 Pro more than the Plus version (or a Poco X5 Pro or Redmi Note 12 5G or a Galaxy A54) for many reasons. Their sizes also fit of what I'm looking for in a phone.

Chinese smartphone makers store user data on chinese servers.
In that Youtube video which I mentioned, he said that only if they're running on chinese rom they collect personal data but if they're running EU roms they only collect your phone model data( not the exact words but the whole point is this, nothing personal is collected!) which all the companies do!
Actually he is referring to a study which is all about data collection!
So, this is not s.th that an individual in Tiktok or Youtube or even on Gsmarena can confirm, it needs research which they have done it!
It is safe to buy those phone even if they're running Chinese rom you can easily flash EU rom on them and enjoy!

When comparing a 2-year-old SoC to newer generations, it is reasonable to expect some performance differences. The camera performance of the F5 has received mixed reviews, with some users criticizing its image quality due to the smaller 1/2 sensor size. In contrast, several other mid-range phones offer larger sensors, which may contribute to better image quality in certain scenarios. It's important to consider various factors, including sensor size, image processing capabilities, and software optimization, when evaluating a smartphone camera's performance. The S21 FE indeed offers a better camera experience, especially with the inclusion of a telephoto lens. However, it's running out of software updates now and having 1 year left.",Neutral

Hello, after disliking the Pixel 7a and Poco F5, i consider buying this. 528€ for 8/256 and 3 ... more
I've had my S21 FE for over a year. I'm a heavy user (productivity apps, movies, music, TV, camera, video & photo post processing, etc.). My battery typically lasts the whole day, but it doesn't matter if it runs low. I've never had a phone that charges this fast. It will go from zero to fifty percent in the advertised 30 minutes. If it's charged 45 minutes, that will bring it to 75% - 80%.
The phone has great WiFi reception and speed capacity, but it does lack the better cellular antenna of it's Samsung brothers. They had to cut corners somewhere, and this was a poor place for them to do it for this device. Not a problem for urban dwelling users, but I live in a rural area with limited coverage. Still, my friend with the cheapest cricket prepaid phone gets better reception than I do when at home (I typically have none, he has 3-5 bars).
Figure out what you want to do with your phone, and where you'll be doing it, then pick the phone for the tasks most important to you.
Even though I do complicated photo and video processing, I've never had any problem with processing power or memory shortages. The main camera is not up to the quality I was expecting, but it gets by for most less than pro level uses. Wouldn't pick it for a portrait, etc. - but I can take memory type shots okay.
While it's been rugged and reliable for a phone that's dropped, etc from heavy use - there's no evidence of any damage from all the knocks it has taken.
While I don't hate my phone, I am sad that I didn't check the antenna quality before purchasing. I “assumed” that a new quasi flagship Samsung would have the best internal components. When I'm in the city it works flawlessly. Sadly I'm in a rural environment most of the time, so I won't recommend to anyone not living in an urban/city environment.
Good luck with whatever phone you choose!",Neutral

Summary: don't buy a new phone without a 2 year waranty. Every phone maker offers a 2 year waranty except Apple which has 1 year of waranty. You can opt for longer waranty if you pay, but 2 years is a minimum, that's a waranty from a OEM directly.

Summary2: avoid buying the cheapest possible offerings from other countries or the cheapest possible mobile phone local stores selling below price as they're often selling devices which are not meant for sale in your area, meaning they lost waranty from the OEM. Instead of real waranty from the brand you buy your phone, you only have a 1 year of waranty, but only at the same store which sold you that phone. And that means, they can do whatever they want, because you are not protected by any laws of your country or that phone maker, nothing.

Better luck next time.

Install third party antivirus and you will not have security problem. The story about security is bloated in my opinion.

As you can see, the price of the s21 FE is more than reasonable and I think that is the real value of the phone. I paid it significantly more. The A series is a excellent mid-range phone, but at this price it has no chance against the s21 fe, even though its display is significantly larger. The s21 fe processor greatly compensates for this and is much better than the A73. Even with the Snapdragon variant, by customizing and putting applications in deep sleep, it heats up less and it is acceptable. Also buy a case :)",Neutral

s10, then s21, no wow!

all the repute improvement, nothing to show at my way of using the phone. sound, standby time
generally use even the 512g memories. I slide all my files and apps. even use the same case.
exep the speed of the transphere or files and apps, it was impressively fast, (it's my six samsung), alway translating to the next phone….

but on using its, the only apparent if rarely use is iv got a ton of unused space
and i put my second account to the galaxy s21 instead of my older s10. i think
the galaxy s21 fe was the limit of perceivable improvement. ok i dont play games
I just took notes, made calls and took some on the spot photos. .

very rarely using the internet or youtube. even those I try just for the sake of trying them….
nothing better or worse, . the only way to keep them apart was buying a colors case

You should keep in mind that this includes a new protocol. The A71 is an older phone. The protocols are different and cannot be directly compared. I see that the A54 ranks well with 107 points of new protocol, and it is a significantly cheaper phone. The A70s was a better class than A50s, so I expected better results for A74 phone. I accept that the colors are more vivid, but some people like it, or not, it is a matter of taste. In my opinion, all this fuss about colors leaves space for fraudulent algorithms such we already have with classic Adobe PhotoShop. When I zoom pictures, I see more clear details in the A71 pictures than in the pictures taken with the S21 FE, and both are viewed on S21 FE. I dislike that I spent money on this phone.

Due to the need for better performance for games, I had to put numerous applications in deep sleep, and set the virtual memory to 2GB RAM. By default it is 4. The system simply activates a number of system applications at the same time and keeps other in virtual memory. By the mentioned customization, the device is now forced to activate them in sequence in smaller groups, and that saves me RAM. In this manner I do not need any third party game booster, the phone's booster and processor have done the job.",Neutral

Must agree that camera is not awesome. But for general purposes is ok. Main sensor is Sony imx555 which is widely used by Samsung. From S20+, to S21+ and Z Fold 3. 12mpx is on lower side this days must agree, but even Pixel 6a used same amount of megapixels and quality there is great.",Neutral

great camera and diplay fantastic speed and goofd battery back up
The display is excellent, battery good, but I would disagree about the main camera. 12MP is too low. Of course, on a 6.4 screen, the pictures will look good, but put it on a bigger screen (eg PC) and you will see that the details are blurred. Samsung tried to compensate the small number of pixels with computer algorithms, but in my opinion this is price cheating. The phone is too expensive for such camera. If 12MP is good why then the S23 ultra has much much larger ie 200MP main camera. The S21FE phone should have had a better main camera. The selfie 32MP camera is good. I also don't understand how Samsung can put a 12MP selfie camera on its flagship phone S23 ultra. They think to compensate for this with a short selfie shooting distance and computer alghoritms, but 12MP is too low! Simply, there are people who see the differences and want better of Samsung, because the competition gives it for lower price!",Neutral

Maybe the plastic back will get scratched by thumbs and fingers if you don't cut your nails. Otherwise, it's perfectly normal plastic. Even quite pleasant to the touch, not a cheap-looking imitation, like the A71 by the way. About overheating, I have never had such a problem! You might be a pretty passionate gamer, but this is definitely not a gaming phone. And if you were so happy with your A71, why didn't you stick with it? When buying any piece of equipment, the wisest thing to do is to do your research, not to whine afterwards that your previous phone was better. The S21FE is a solid phone that has given me absolutely no problems. Zero! It's your fault that you didn't make a simple effort to research what you were buying. Once it doesn't fit your needs, sell it and stop spewing out your personal frustrations caused by your sloppy exploitation.",Neutral

You are entitled to your opinion. The plastic of the S21 FE is easily damaged at the edges and scratched even by palms and fingers. You have to use protection, which is ridiculous considering the price of the phone. I used the A71 without any protection and the plastic is just fine. Simply put, the S21 FE is not for gamers, but for delicate women's hands. Also, the phone overheats like crazy easily, which affects performance. If I could go back, I would bypass the S21 FE in a wide arc, and Samsung engineers, as far as I'm concerned, are ridiculous, and failed the exam. And if that plastic is so good, just look at the cut-off price when it needs to be replaced, as I needed!

Overall, the build quality of iPhone 13 is much better, but S21 fe will feature you more specs(120Hz refresh rate, bigger screen, one extra telephoto camera and android that give you unlimited access) iam not comfortable with ios and believe that it's designed to simple task: text call and only applications allowed from app store but android has advanced file sharing and download manager there is no task you can't do with android.

The lack of headphones socket also does not bother me. I prefer to stream my music on my BT speakers rather than having two plugs in my ears for prolonged intervals.

To be honest, I am very pleased with its performance, even though it may be a phone from Jan 2022.

It has the following features which I really like:

1. Virtually all hardware from its S flagship (and more expensive) siblings.
2. Has the wonderful DeX facility (enabling me to use the S21FE on my PC).
3. Captures beautiful snaps (day and night).
4. Promised OS updates for 4 years and security updates for 5 years.
5. It has great nifty features like object eraser (delete unwanted objects from photos), live transcribe (capture voice to text in the go), Good Lock module (allowing me to customise my phone to a great extent).
6. It is a lovely size which fits perfectly in my pocket.
7. It has in-built call recorder feature which works wonderful for me.
8. It has IP68 rating which should provide adequate protection for my phone.

Now, I do not play games and I don't need blazing fast speed. I use the phone mainly for content (social media, emails, and news). The Exynos is perfectly fine with me and it does not get too warm. I have opted for power saving performance and with all unnecessary (for me) features turned off, I can easily use the phone for 1 day.

All this for Rs 32,000 ($390 USD).

Updates are there for the betterment of your phone and they're monthly not weekly as mentioned by you. A 6.4 inch phone is not at all huge as it's a perfect size compared to bigger phones like the ultras, every phone is prone to scratches if used roughly that's why we've phones cases of all types, almost all the phones flagships or budget are coming without chargers or other accessories lately and talking about the cameras they're extremely efficient in taking photos in any lighting conditions with plenty of details and can be compared with the latest models at the same price.

Friends! What do you suggest me. Actually, I have the S21 fe as my daily driver but it really... more
A23 5G is larger phone so it can fit more battery inside. S21 FE is more compact and besides that it has much bigger sensors for their camera system which take more space inside the phones case.

It depends what do you want from a phone and what is your prioirity when you're buying a new phone. It also depends which type of user you are. If you're power user wanting 5+ hours of screen time per day then S21 FE is not for you.

3.5mm jack is nice to have, but for me personaly camera results and software stability is more important. I'm not a power user at all. Barely watching youtube from time to time. Never playing any games. I'm mainly focused on messaging, browsing and taking pics. S21 FE is for those who want a flagship grade preformance on a lower budget as it comes with few compromises but lower price too. S21 FE has a much better sowftare then A23 5G. I know it sounds confusing because both carry the same version of One UI, but all brands treat their flagships clients better then for those on lower class of devices.

My wife has a S21 FE and she's pretty much happy with everything especially the camera which is why she choose it in the first place, but... She would also want a better battery. Why? Well.. because she's on fricking Tik Tok scrolling that crap all day long. Even when working.. lol

I agree. Mine uses the exynos and it never overheats so far even when gaming. Rarely gets hot, sometimes only ticking a bit hot in extensive use which is totally normal i think.

I would say Xiaomi 12T Pro for best performance, battery and Camera.
not necesserily, you shouldnt only look at the performance, cameras and battery.

while yes, the performance on paper is better on the 12t pro, you probably wouldnt notice unless you play games on ultra settings for a long period of time.

the cameras are subjectif, i personally like samsungs cameras more, but it depends on the user. you also get a telephoto camere (8mp 3x optical zoom).

the battery is probably better on the 12t pro, because the 8 gen 1+ is more energy efficient, i get about 5-6 hours of screen on time on my s21fe, while limiting battery percentage to 85%. So id probably get a bit more if i let it get full.

Now thats all for performance, battery and cameras, now lets check the software side. The 12t pro will get three major os updates (including android 13) and four years of security updates. While the s21fe will get four major os updates (including android 13) and five years of security updates.

I personally went for the s21fe for the software side and the performance is allready really good. It can run genshin impact, which is a nuke on phone gaming, on the highest settings without problems. Except for the heating and battery drain.

In conclusion, i personally prefer the s21fe because of the software updates and the allready really good performance. I hope what i said could help a bit and im always open to be told if i said something wrong.",Neutral

It really comes down to money in my opinion. If you have the money, get the S22. If you'd rather go easy on your wallet, get the S21 FE. I would personally go for the S22 for a variety of reasons, including updates. The new OneUI 5 update being the prime example at the moment.",Neutral

Apart from haptics everything else is good (in fact once you start using phone, you will get used to haptics in a week as well).

- Battery life is very good (I get one day easily on 120 hz refresh rate with SOT of 4 hours)
- Cameras are also very good. You get social media ready photos right out of the shooter

Imo u should get the exynos, I've heard less complaints about it as compared to the sd888. I have an exynos myself and battery is very good if not excellent, lasts about 8hr sot and I mostly use battery protect limit to 85% and get about 6hr ish on that. And what really surprised me that this phone remains cool(I live in a hot climate region) it is noticeably cooler than my previous midrange snapdragon phone, although it will get warm when u use the camera for a bit.",Neutral
Gate,10954,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G ,2022-09-14 00:00:00.000000,"Almost 2 months since i bought this device, i'll type out my pros and cons on this one.

I've been a long user of Samsung, always loved the fresh look and feel of their OneUI, love how smooth it's been especially with the 120 HZ. The perfomance is above and beyond what i expected (Snapdragon version), it runs every application and every game that exists without any issues. Plenty of internal storage for me, lots of applications, over 200 pictures and around 20-ish videos on it, still got 50 GB free (128 GB device). Charges up within 40 mins max, camera quality is fantastic for my needs both taking pictures and recording videos. Weigh is perfect for me, so is the size of the phone, fits in my small pocket without any issues. Plenty of RAM as well considering that i am a heavy user and how much apps i've got installed that require to be run in the background, multitasking is a no problem. Display looks extremely nice, flagship type of display should i say, very satisfied. Does mention dual-speakers on it, the bottom one is just a bit louder than the one in the earphone, but depending on the position of your hands, it's nice to watch videos or movies on it. Microphone quality be it either while recording or while talking to someone in calls is expected to be of high quality, which it does deliver indeed.

The one major downside to this device in my opinion is the Battery. I've enabled charging limit to 85% the first day i bought this device. Even on some basic usage throughout the day (Putting somewhere around 20 mins gaming, 30 mins browsing, 2 hours max of watching videos) drops me down from 85% to around 30%, Youtube itself takes at least 36% of battery, the rest are some apps that run in the background, but all together doesn't add up to the percentage loss, so there's something else that eats up the battery (Power saving feature is always on which means limited background activity, 70% cpu speed, turned off always-on display, 60 HZ, no 5g which i don't have in my country anyway), the SOT (screen-on-time) always ends up at 4 hours MAX, even next to the almost 100 deep-sleeping apps which is quite disappointing. I recommend a powerbank if you're a heavy user.

The second not really major for a non-gaming person is that this phone can heat up quite a lot if you game on it. The processor is known to be quite unoptimized (efficiency wise) and to be a heat generator, so it will heat up a lot and quickly (also drain your battery a lot faster) if you try to have longer gaming sessions on it on perfomance-hog games (such as PUBG, Genshin and such), so if your plan is to game a lot on this device at home, my advice is to buy one of those fan coolers for phones.

No 3.5mm jack which does not affect me at all since i own bluetooth earphones and headphones, but it could cause an issue for some, also no memory card slot to expand your memory.

My recommendation is to buy a screen protector and a case for this one right after you buy the device. Just a simple maybe 5cm drop on concrete left a scratch on the side, so a case is a MUST if you don't want to leave marks on your phone.",Neutral

For me, personally, battery life is absolutely fine. Definitely better than s22. Sot varies between 5-7hrs without drop refresh rate to 60hz or any other battery optimization tricks. Screen brightness on 60-70% constantly. I have seen people achieve 8+ hrs sot with airplane mode over the night, dropping to 60hz refreshrate and other battery saver tricks, but that's not for me. Im totally fine with whole day lasting battery. I plug it into the charger before bed with 10-15% battery left. Definitely is not a battery champ phone, but not the bad battery performer also. Mine is SD 888 ver. Never feels lag, freezing or anything like that. I make good research bfor buying that phone. Going and trying it to the store and i was sure that this the phone i want. Im a samsung fan, didn't hide that. Bfor i was using Huawei, Motorola and ZTE, but find that samsungs fits better to my taste. Im not ""every year change phone"" guy, so samsung update policy was one of the key things also. So make your research bfor buy phone to not be disappointed after that. Good luck.",Neutral

Which is better S21 FE or 11 pro max? And why, please give detailed analysis. Thank you
Hey!

As someone who has had S21 FE and sold it for iPhone 11 Pro Max, here's what i think (this is gonna be a bit of an in-depth ""review/comparison"". So if you don't want to read all of this, my pick would definitely be the iPhone!!!

But i love writing reviews so here it is:



—Screen Pros and Cons on iPhone:

~Decent brightness, comfortably visible in sunlight
~Nice screen size (6,5""), similar in size to FE
~Sharper screen resolution compared to FE
~~The notch can be a bit intrusive when watching full screen content or gaming, thought i don't really notice it with regular use
~~Display is 60Hz unlike FE's 120Hz which means better battery life, but not nearly as buttery smooth scrolling as you'd get on FE



—Battery on iPhone:
~Lasts me the whole day, even though i have 85% Battery Health, so thats around 7,5 - 8 hours of screen on time, though i assume that it would last even longer if i replaced the battery but since it lasts long enough even on 85% i think im gonna wait before i go ahead and replace it!
~When it comes to charging it up, it does take maybe an hour or so to get it to around 85-90ish % with the 18W Apple charger that came with the phone, but i did test it and you can get 50% in 30 minutes so charging speed is alright
~Take notice that the phone heats up quite a lot when its ""fast"" charging so a tip i learned is to avoid placing ur phone on surfaces that conduct heat (blankets,table cloths, etc.) and instead keep it on wood or glass or generally something where the phone can disperse heat (and make sure to remove ur phone case while charging if it causes excessive heat)



—Cameras on iPhone:
~Sadly i was pretty disappointed with camera performance on 11 Pro Max, i expect more and i would say that i like the photos from my old iPhone X more, but that's subjective, so overall, the camera performance in good lighting conditions is pretty good, as soon as there's less light you either get meh photos or you have to use the ""night mode"" and you have to have a really steady hands to hold ur phone still for couple of seconds to get a decent shot in lower light
~When it comes to camera diversity, its almost exactly the same as on S21 FE (it has an ultra-wide, a wide, and a telephoto {zoom} camera)
~Videos in daylight are awesome as expected from an iPhone, but again when you are shooting in-doors the results are quite disappointing but oh well its a smartphone after all..



—Honorable mentions about iPhone:
~Even though its a 2019 model, it's still gonna get years and years of software updates, so it will most likely outlast the Samsung in software longevity
~Its an iPhone, apps are decently optimized for it (camera quality and stabilization on instagram,snapchat,tiktok etc.) and haptic feedback in games (beatstar, candy crush and so on and so forth) so basically you get the most out of almost any app, cause it's literally made for this OS
~If you have any other Apple devices (AirPods, iPad...) it will integrate amazingly with the Apple ecosystem and it's not that old of a phone so it will have all of the latest features (software-wise) like continuity camera...
~And, like it or not, its an iPhone, it has that apple on the back and it's most likely gonna be viewed as a status piece, people are gonna notice it especially if you live somewhere where iPhones are not so prominent.



—And now the Samsung:
⚠️(I owned a SnapDragon version so i don't know if all of these apply to the Exynos version)⚠️



—Screen on the FE:
~Well there's not too much to complain about, its a nice screen with surprisingly good brightness and good visibility even in direct sunlight
~The punch hole, while smaller than iPhone notch, is still quite annoying to look at, cause its in the middle of the screen.. i much more like the solution of putting punch hole selfie cam in the corner (like Xiaomi does)
~The bezels are quite thin which i like, tought i don't like how the chin (bottom bezel) is noticeably thicker than the other ones, but with regular use, just like the notch you don't really notice that bezels are uneven
~Its a 1080p screen which is not as sharp as the iPhone and pixels are visible if you really look for them but oh well, its fine for what it is
~It obviously has 120Hz which is awesome, except the fact that its not variable, so even though you have a phone with high refresh rate, it sucks up battery juice so much that you wonder why is it even a thing, and unlike the other manufacturers, Explodesung did not take their time to make that screen go to 60Hz when, for example watching a YT video, so you could be watching a 30fps video, and the screen would still be refreshing at 120Hz, pointlessly draining battery (there's a fix for that, Bixby Routines, but COME ON SAMSUNG!!😒)
~Also i had responsiveness issues but most of these are software issues, and software is sometimes samsung does horribly but i know that half of these issues could be fixed with.. well.. software :)



—Battery on the FE:
~When it comes to battery life i was VERY disappointed as were many people who got the phone, i had to charge it to get me through the day and i would generally get 5-ish ours of SoT (which was later improved to 5.5-6 with software updates but even that was a stretch)
~Charging speed was also devastatingly disappointing since it could charge at 25W MAX and it would take 1h10/20 minutes to fully charge, which is literally how long it took for my Galaxy A40 with a 15W charger when i had that one..
~Also, Scamsung decided that they wanted to be generous and only include a whole ass cable 😨 and NO CHARGER?! so i had to pay extra for that...
~Aaand the heat this phone would produce while charging was ALARMING i was scared it was gonna blow my hand off cus of how hot it would get (maybe thats a snapdragon thing idk, cus the processor was running hot+the battery while charging, it was a disaster) oh well..



—Cameras on the FE:
~I was actually surprised with camera performance on this phone, the photos it made were decent and somewhat consistent
~What i didn't like was the over-processing of photos, aka the infamous ""scene optimizer"" which i highly recommend you turn off!! It made photos extremely over-saturated (maybe you like your greens to look almost-neon but it looked quite unnatural) and it over-sharpens in areas it shouldn't so you get messy photos but then you can't have text recognition cus that turns off too when you disable scene optimizer, ugh!!
~Ultrawide camera is alright but i did notice that samsungs software distortion fixing thingy sometimes doesn't work that well so you get warpy photos but its a usable camera nevertheless
~The telephoto camera is what really surprised me! I loved it, it made sharp, good photos, with digital zoom that could go up to 30X!! (Yes i did get some moon shots too 😄) so the telephoto is a big plus on this phone
~When it comes to video (at least 4K) i was pleasantly surprised to see how far has videography come on samsung phones, the outdoor footage was actually really nice, sharp, and the colors weren't too off as well!! Definitely comparable to iPhone in my humble opinion :)
~Front camera is something that really suprised me too!!
While just snapping a quick ""normal"" photo would lend you some crappy, over-processed results that looked like i had some sort of filter on me ( i did disable beauty filters i never use those), using the night mode on the front camera really surpassed my expectations on imagery a front camera can produce, with it producing fantastic photos even in low light!!! (A drawback to this is that you have to be still when taking them (obviously) and it takes a veeeeery long time for the phone to process those photos, but believe me its worth it!!!) so if you're someone who loves taking selfies this phone is a solid contender, even the video on the selfie camera is really good (it does do 4K 60)



—And for some honorable mentions for the FE:
~Its built of quite cheap-feeling aluminum frame and a cheapy (but durable) plasticky back so if you dont use a case, this phone feels like an A52 even though its more expensive the build quality is cheap af
~Samsungs software is horrendous, that was the main reason i sold this phone, it was glitchy, the animations flew all over the place, it just didn't feel like a flagship from a software perspective... (rly sad cus i love OneUI)
~Camera quality and in general 3rd party app experience on for example snapchat is NOTHING compared to iPhone, its so bad that i was constantly frustrated and annoyed by all the bugs and problems i had with 3rd party apps
~Snapdragon, as i said, while it is pretty fast, it gets veeeery hot so prolonged intense use is not possible on this phone without it getting hot af
