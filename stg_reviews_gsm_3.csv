Custom Rom Man,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,vtx,24 Apr 2023,"Had the Note 11 since launch and thought I'd pitch in my experience.

Using Miui, this is an absolutely horrendus phone that provides a far lower tier of experience than my Redmi Note 5. I wouldn't be able to use this thing on Miui for more than a week without vomiting violently and wishing for a cataclysmic event to end the suffering of all Miui users.

However with a custom rom (even without the kernel sources being released by Xiaomi, a violation and breach of the General Public License but as if Google has the competence to do anything), but a custom rom missing the actual Note 11 kernel sources, and having issues with tap 2 wake, even with all that, this phone is an absolute work of art to use and play with. I find myself holding it without a case, caressing it and just staring at the beauty of being able to use a AUD250 dollar phone without any issues at all. Now bare in mind I have zero care about camera specs or 4k 60 frames etc. I care more about the general performance, display quality, build quality, nfc and custom rom support. For me the camera just has to be good enough to capture some nice cars on the streets or a great view of the clouds, I don't take selfies or any of that rubbish.

But wow running unofficial LineageOS, this thing is so buttery smooth, I don't have the words to explain the ecstasy I feel after successfully completing a day in life using a AUD250 dollar phone, and luckily I got the elusive NFC version that Xiaomi seems to take insult at selling.

I truly do not understand how the makers of Miui go to sleep at night. They do everything in their power to ruin such beautiful hardware, Miui has become worse beyond measure, in every sense of the word. How is it possible the same hardware that can be so lust worthy running LineagoOS turns into a pure soul sucking turn off the second Miui's slash screen is shown.

These people are not human, the makers of Miui, they come from a evil place, here just to ruin everyone's day.

If Google forced OEM's like Xiaomi to release a stock rom image that had all the kernel sources, and was stock Android, even if I had to flash it myself, but it was available, every single Xiaomi, realme, oppo, whoever else phone would become 500 times better.

Android OEM skins are killing every Android phone in the budget category and Google with all its incompetence is just watching and doing nothing. Oh sorry my bad, Google is busy trying to screw up tablets for the 5th time.

I now wait for custom rom support before buying a new Xiaomi phone, ever since they now force you to use the 3 button layout on 3rd party launchers, I cannot use a Xiaomi phone unless it's running a custom rom.

Anyhow, that was my story. I applaud anyone that uses this phone with Miui, you are a far stronger man than I."

The only point I'll give you is the camera quality (because older models like Redmi Note 8 can record in 4k and such), but most of your complains can be fixed with workarounds, including the camera one:

- GCam takes better pictures than MIUI Camera, and you should always use that one instead, (complaining that the stock camera is bad is the equivalent of using Internet Explorer on Windows and complaining that they can't browse the web properly).

- The background task reloading is not a hardware issue, but a software feature (MIUI), if I remember correctly it's called ""com.miui.powerkeeper"", this is a MIUI battery optimization service that aggressively kills apps in the background for a negligible battery gain. Rather than disabling it through ADB, you're better off changing MIUI altogether with a custom ROM.

- MIUI bugs, bloatware and ads are also solved with the solution above (unlocking bootloader and installing a custom ROM)

I know most people can't be bothered to solve these issues, but you gotta remember that it is YOUR phone, and like another guy said earlier, you should try to maximize its capabilities so you end up with the best possible version your phone can become. Xiaomi phones are good hardware/bad software, and luckily the latter can be fixed by the end user."

That's your opinion and it doesn't apply to others. Reading your words, seems like you are an amateur or a newb. You didn't even mention your phone specs and I assume it's the lower variant 4/64 gb. Factory restore your device and your phone sluggishness will be resolved then update it to the latest MIUI available. This may improve the camera and overall performance. Don't fill your storage loaded with your personal stuffs nor download apps that you aren't really going to use. Tightly squeezed storage with 4 gb RAM means trouble. Use microSD card to store your data.

Fingerprint issue is your fault. It's not 720p as well and this just shows how ignorant someone can be. You see, not every single issue should be blamed to the manufacturer, it is in the hands of the user on how to maximize the phone's capability. In addition, it's the user's responsibility to learn and take care of the device."

Why would you buy a budget device to play heavy games, specially something like COD?
If you want to play heavy games, then get a device that has no trouble playing heavy games."
gyro,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,8A5,11 Mar 2023,"I managed to grab the 128GB 6GB RAM (Global) version 4 months ago for around $180.
I am genuinely surprised about how good it is for this price range. I am even more happy with it than what I was when I first had my last phone (RN7). Currently running MIUI Global 13.0.7 Stable.
The performance is pretty good. I didn't expect much from the 90Hz mode based on my past experience with MIUI but I have to say I am utterly surprised at how smooth it is. I expected the usual MIUI stuttering from past versions but there is none of that. I can't really go back to 60Hz now. It's very close to a flagship experience. Performance in apps is great, not much to be said here. Now, to be fair I debloated it. Removed quite a bit of MIUI preloaded apps and some of Google's ones I don't use. I recommend doing this if you are getting this phone (or any phone running MIUI for that matter). You only need developer settings and USB debugging (no need for security settings, which require an account). Use a tool like Universal Android Debloater (open source) which will only let you uninstall safe-to-remove apps so you don't end up accidentally breaking your MIUI install.
The display itself is decent, as expected from Samsung panels and AMOLED. It also has good brightness levels, even under the blinding tropical sun.
I didn't expect it to have stereo speakers at this price range. I genuinely thought I was crazy for a second when I was watching a video with the loudspeakers on. Had to come here to double check and realize it has stereo speakers. The loudness is decent and the sound is clear enough.
The camera is decent for this price range and it supports gcam. It's not flagship tier but with gcam, you get a noticeable improvement in quality. I must also admit that the MIUI camera app has improved a lot, specially in quality and usability. I've hear long time gcam users dropping gcam and going back to the basics, the MIUI camera app. I guess it's a matter of taste. Also, I find myself using the document scanner feature of MIUI camera a lot, it's very handy. The low light performance is what you'd expect for a sensor of this price range, but that doesn't mean you can't get decent low light pictures specially with gcam.
As for gaming, I wouldn't call myself a mobile gamer but I do play the occasional gacha. Be aware that this is NOT a gaming phone. Sure, it will run something like AL or BA (even with high settings) with no problems, but don't expect to run heavier games like Genshin or PUBG with high settings, specially not at 90Hz.
As for battery life, I am quite happy with it. I get around 60 hours from a full charge with low to medium usage (checking whatsapp and insta). The included charger is a 33W one so you get fast charge from the get go. Remember that mine is debloated so perhaps stock MIUI probably gets less hours.
The only few things that I found to be a bit annoying are the following:
- Sometimes the fingerprint sensor can be hit or miss. Although this could also be partly my fault because my hands sweat a lot.
- With Always On Display, when you tap the screen to view notifications and/or the time, the screen sometimes takes a while to turn on.
- Sometimes, you can notice a flicker when the screen switches from 90Hz to 60Hz in order to save battery.
These are minor inconveniences though. I am very happy with this device.
I genuinely think it is the best phone in the $180~$220 budget market.
If you are looking for a device in that price range then look no further."

In terms of gaming, phone locks at 60 fps with any Graphics settings while playing wild Rift.

Actually, when I ran Pubg for the first time it was very slow and had only smooth and normal Graphics options. I was very disappointed at first. However, ƒ∞dk what helped it, its Either game turbo or gfx tool I was able to get 60 fps locked with better graphics.then, I Read a comment somewhere suggesting cleaning Battery and performance app, did ƒ±t and got 90 FPS on PUBG without any heating issue.

Basically, when u unlock the cpu s real performance u can get even 90 fps on pubg but by default it is pretty limited.

PC,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,mhw,17 Feb 2023,"The worst phone I've ever buy so far
I own this phone since June, I didn't think cheap phones were that bad, at the same price, you'd better go with an older mid-range smartphone or something. Don't get fooled by the reviews.
The camera is really bad, especially with the default app.
MIUI has a lot of bugs, I never passed a day without the phone crashing at least once.
When you have one task in background, it has to reload everytime you switch between the apps like the memory couldn't handle 2 tasks open at the same time, this is by far the most annoying thing on this phone because you switch between applications everytime.
More than being really bad, MIUI also includes a lot of bloatwares and adds. My phone has fallen once and it has broken the fingerprint sensor. The power button was therefore heating a lot and I had to unplug it physically opening the phone as it is not possible to disable the fingerprint sensor by software.
The autonomy was ok at the start but after 6 months it has decreased a lot so now it's just bad, it just last a single day. For a phone with a 5000mAh battery, 720p screen and low consuming SOC and bad RAM this is just awful. I can't wait to buy an other phone, this time I will not buy a entry level smartphone because you can feel the economy made everywhere"

Sometimes it can't turn itself on, so I have to turn it off again. It can even turns itself off when I am not using it, so I have to have other phone with alarms to wake up in the morning (and that phone is a much older Xiaomi, that works much better than this thing).

I bitterly regret having bought it after reading praise on some sites, by journalists surely handsomely paid by Xiaomi to write. Yet I was a big fan of the xiaomi mi 9t but there nothing to do. Under high-end tunes, the quality of night photos is catastrophic. Among the reasons:
- the quality of night photos is catastrophic
- The quality of the video looks like a phone from the year 2000.
- my ""location"" icon disappeared and impossible to put it back.
- From Facebook, the web links do not work.
- photo editing works half the time (""please download the editing tool"" 3 times a day when it is already installed).
- Add to that pop-up ads on the phone (that's probably why it's so cheap), mainly on the music app! You can't listen to music on your phone without having an advertisement, it's like being on youtube.
- my Gmail and my Google maps do not work when I am on the Orange network. But they work when I activate my SIM Free. Why? I don't know but it's not orange's fault because it worked on my old phone.
- And a real slowness...
The only advantage is its battery which lasts really long even with good use. Another advantage: it is so slow that I spend less time on my phone. In short, don't be fooled by the attractive price. Better to spend a little more and have a phone that holds up."

Just bought it in early November. it's not bad, the main issue I found is that when watching on youtube or Facebook for several hours, it's bound to lag and eventually crash, and some parts of MIUI are pretty bad. some features I use are missing like locking certain apps in the Recent button so I don't accidentally clear them."

I've updated my Redmi Note 11 to Android 12 & MiUi 13,so far so good. Well if you guys really hate or don't like Xiaomi than much better that you guys don't buy any of their phones. Just buy other brands which is suitable for you. That's it simple easy. Peace."

Anybody knows when will android 12 come for note 11 global? Waiting too long honestly
-my friend, if you really want to upgrade to android 12 you can do it right now using fastboot method. basically you download the official xiaomi fastboot firmware for your redmi note 11 model, then install it in your device using fastboot method with your computer.
-the reason why you haven't (and everybody else) received android 12 update because it has a different version association. let me explain: this is an example of a build number ""13.0.1.0.RGKEUXM"" based on android 11. the update system only shows you the available updates that have this part ""RGKEUXM"" exactly the same, like updating from ""13.0.1.0.RGKEUXM"" to ""13.0.12.0.RGKEUXM"", both of these are based on android 11.
but android 12 version had this build number ""13.0.1.0.SGKEUXM"", as you can see starts with S not R, the system update thinks this is incompatible with your device because of that difference, but we know for sure that they are 100% compatible since they are coming directly from xiaomi.
-I think xiaomi did it expectedly to differenciate between the two major versions, but they forgot that system update mecanism won't show you the major update because of the difference in build number association.
note: I do have this phone, and these infos are based on my expert understanding, I could be inaccurate on my wordings of things or on some points."

Hy everyone, I've been using the Redmi note 11 for a month now and here's my honest ... more
Agree with this review.
However, MIUI has never really been the strong point of Xiaomi phones, specially from the optimization standpoint. Even the average consumer who has never used a Xiaomi phone has heard about how unoptimized and bloated MIUI is.
Thankfully, you can do debloating without the need to root. There is a tool that lets you uninstall system/preloaded apps which alleviates the bloat problem up to an extent. There's also alternatives like xiaomi.eu which are less bloated by default and offers more features and flexibility, but do require a bit more of technical knowledge to install."
Onix,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,Nu6,27 Oct 2022,"Hy everyone, I've been using the Redmi note 11 for a month now and here's my honest review.

Starting at this price range, I believe it's a great device considering the fact you'll also get a 33w fast charger and a sweet clear TPU case also.

In my first month of usage, I noticed MIUI isn't really optimized, I mean coming from a Samsung one UI experience with my Galaxy a31 4+64, I think MIUI is choopy and somehow laggy especially in the multitasking window.

And ram management could be better too, come on Xiaomi, even with 6gigs+2gig of ram, I still experience app crashing in the background every 10 to 15 minutes, that's quite disappointing because my Galaxy a31 even with 4gigs of ram does a better job in ram management

Camera department: I would say for basic users, it's good.
Although photos tend to be more saturated under sunlight, I still think it's ok for simple users who aren't really into photography.

Battery: well, it gets me through the day with full charge, although I locked the refresh rate at 90hz and always on 4G+
I'd say it does pretty well in the battery segment.

Display: This is where I give the device a huge thumbs up üëç, I mean, the color accuracy and brightness level are so good for a midrange device. Deep blacks and sweet vivid colors can be achieved with this display.

Speakers: very good speakers I must say, although it lacks a little bit of bass, but it's ok and loud enough for anyone to enjoy audio consumption with it.

Build quality: Very good for this price range, no back glass like the pro models but the material used on here is great üëç

PROS:
* Sweet AMOLED display and 90hz refresh rate.
* Reliable battery.
* Good stereo speakers.
* Fits properly in hand, not too bulky and heavy to use.

CONS:
* MIUI optimization could have been better."

I agree. So many bugs ever since I impulsively updated the miui 12 to 13. I hope they'll fix the bugs soon. The camera is a total disaster even if it's 50mp on the rear side, I think this is what u get with the low specs (snapdragon 680) except if you have a cool app for camera and is expert when it comes to editing and enhancing. Gaming is good but I think 6gb ram and a snapdragon 680 isn't enough. Though I still love this because a family member gifted this to me and as much as possible I want to appreciate and see this phone's beauty. I needed the sd card slot and headphone jack anyway, plus the amoled screen is excellent, the stereo is great, and the 90hz is kinda okay, so yeah 50/50 rating for a budget phone. (I'm still a kid though so I think this still suits me.)"

NEGATIVES:

Camera not as good as made out to be.

Annoying message to not cover the fingerprint sensor.

Changes in quality whilst using airpods but not sure about other brands. Would go from good to inside a tin. That bad.

Only happened once but couldn't be at a worse time, the phone just wouldn't turn on. Had taken about 15 mins before it reset itself. Weird.

DeltaPlays,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,I@H,28 Sep 2022,"okay, im a bit late to the party with this one, and im usually not one to hate on manufacturers. but can we just talk about how this was a literal downgrade from the redmi note 10?

the only upgrades we got were a slightly better CPU, a GPU that's better in half the cases and worse in the other half, and a 90Hz screen.
these are all in comparison to the redmi note 10 btw
we lost some peak brightness. okay, just 100 nits isn't a big deal. the camera sensor is almost 30% smaller than last gen, with 1080p 30fps as the highest video resolution and framerate allowed. xiaomi, seriously?
and the sad part is that since this phone is directed mostly towards lower end consumers, it's actually going to sell well and no one is going to notice. the numbers are larger, i mean, the 11 must be better than the 10 right? 50mp is better than 48, right?
that's the thing. what triggers me is that this ridiculous move by xiaomi is going to work and we all know it darn well

wasnt expecting this one from xiaomi. when i first checked these units out irl and saw the video quality drop, i thought the demo models had some kind of cap set in place. absolutely would not give my redmi note 10 for this one"

1 - it lags on basic apps, not even games, it lags on YouTube, Instagram and other apps after some hours of use
2 - it randomly closes apps after running them, I was watching a movie and then it just casually closes the app
3 - this is the worst point, I changed my font, and then my wallpaper started to restart to the default wallpaper, I tried to change it back but after a couple of minutes it changes it back to default ( The lock screen takes longer to go back to default idk why )
4 - now this isn't a problem but when you try to change the wallpaper by pressing and holding in the home screen and press on the wallpaper thingy it doesn't go to the gallery or even make you choose to go to the gallery or the themes app, it just takes you to the themes app, which nobody would ever want to take a wallpaper from, and there is no setting to stop it.

Edit : I just got service update and the first problem was fixed, but it still closes them after which is kinda useless to fix the first problem and just leave the second, because ofc you won't continue to use apps after it lags and you would just close it."

SilentGhost,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,rXP,29 Aug 2022,"Bought this phone yesterday new for the equivalent of 175 USD, this is out of the box settings I got:
Redmi Note 11 Twilight Blue 4GB 64GB NFC
Product Model: 2201117TY
MIUI Version: MIUI Global 13.0.1 Stable 13.0.1.0(RGKEUXM)
Android Version: 11 RKQ1.211001.001
Security Update: 12/2021
Storage: ~24GB/64GB occupied. (Out of the box)
Pro tips: I always set my phones up without connecting them to the internet. After I correct all the settings and disable all auto-updates, and uninstall all the junk apps and so on... Only then I connect my phone to Wi-Fi.

First impressions after 1 Day of use:

The good:
-Very good display.
-Very good speakers.
-Very good 33W fast charging.
-Good design and color.
-Okay battery life.
-Okay camera.
-MIUI software is feature rich.

The bad:
-software settings presets are very bad.
-software needs some getting used to.

to expand a little on what I mean software presets are bad out of the box is:
RAM Memory Extension is Enabled by default.
Dual 4G is enabled by default.
Screen Notification when phone is asleep is on by default.
and soooo many other bad settings, either for user-experience or for your battery life (thank god 90Hz not on by default LOL).

all in all, the phone looks good, amazing display, solid performance and nice design."

If you want to buy Redmi note 11, 6GB RAM version is better."
MVZ,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,xq5,28 Aug 2022,"Short answer: Awful phone.

Long answer:
Previously I had Samsung Galxy A50 which was released 3 years prior to this thing and cost me less, so if I have to, I`ll compare Redmi Note 11 to that phone.

Pros:
90 Hz screen (no one uses it but nevertheless that`s still an advantage)
In-button fingerprint scanner
OK battery

Cons:
Disgusting OS.
I knew that MIUI is considered to be a bad OS in general, but it still managed to surprise me. I used OneUI for almost 3 years and during that time the phone froze only like twice (when you can`t even turn the screen off). Redmi Note 11 froze twice in a span of week. Oh, and less serious lags appear daily.
My version of MIUI has no splitscreen. Well, obviously all Androids have this feature, but on this phone you can`t directly use it. This can be solved by installing third-party app from GooglePlay.
This system doesn`t hold apps in RAM by default. E.g. you were using YouTube, decided to switch to a browser for a split second and when you come back to YouTube it restarts. So if user doesn`t know about specific option in dev settings then they`re sentenced to constant app loading and reloading.

Terrible camera.
All budget smartphones have terrible camera, but on top of that, this phone (and other Xiaomi ones) have almost no noise reduction.

Outrageous performance.
Despite having bigger numbers in CPU specs and achieving higher scores (comparing to A50) in online tests, in real life Note 11 underperforms in every single aspect: wether it`s a resourceful app, video processing or playing games (if fist two is hard but still possible to do, gaming is an act of masochism).

I had good experience with Xiaomi laptops, so I decided to give their phones a try.
Now I deeply regret it."

Tell it as it is,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,Mu%,26 Aug 2022,"As a new Redmi 11 owner who really looked forward to this phone, I will give you an honest opinion, Xiaomi are one of the worst companies I have ever had the experience to encounter. Firstly despite saying their phones support WiFi Calling this does not appear to be the case (out of the box), I had to call their tech support on several occasions as there was not option to turn it on. I was told nothing could be done, as it was the networks fault, they could not support WiFi calling (EE??). On speaking to the network they told me it was definitely the phone and gave me the advice to ring Xiaomi's support and suggest they try inserting a certain *# code, something the EE tech support had read on the net. I did and Xiaomi were ""oh yes"", that worked and got me to the point where I could now turn WiFi calling on and off, However it was still not stable, the last 2 1/2 weeks has just been, me ringing Xiaomi technical support and them after doing the same troubleshooting every time, just saying someone will contact you within 24-48 hours. As yet no one ever has called me back. Every 48 hours, I have to ring them, 3 calls ago I asked to speak to a supervisor, as all this someone will get back to you was becoming ridiculous, from that point a supervisor has been going to ring me back 1st one in a one hour time slot, the second two, 'a supervisor will return your call within 24-48 hours', of course this did not happen either, now the excuse is, the telephone system the supervisors use has been down for 96 hours now. If you take nothing else away from this, a phone company that can not even keep their own phones working???"

Don't be so harsh on it lol it's not meant to be pro model or anything like that, I have one but i don't main it, though i don't disagree with what you said, the camera is so mid for the price i tried to do everything in the pro mode to make it look decent but then again ive only tried shooting in low light, records only at 1080p30.
The specs are pretty good though, snap680, 4gb ram and 5000mah is a really nice pairing, but it's a Xiaomi so there's a chance it bricks itself from a software update

All in all, really decent phone, but doesn't deserve the 200 euro price tag, should be no more than 150"

Performance is good. Most apps work fine. Smooth scrolling in 90hz. For gaming, it's just fine like it's stable for low mid-graphics. For example, cod runs at a stable 60 fps in low mid, same as PES. For demanding games like Genshin Impact, it will not run well, so mush fps drop.

Also, the device temp is very stable. It never goes above 41c in heavy usage, which is very good in summer."

Well, I can do anything with my phone for a whole week with these settings and it's not limiting me at all- I get all push msgs/RDS msgs... Sorry, but I'm not a smartphone addict and I buy phone once per 5 years. Since I care only about battery endurance, OS/ security updates, metal body (not anymore), usage smoothness & I miss NFC so much on my current phone. I'm rarely on-the-go, so it is eligibile. I use data only when I want to urgently check on something, navigation turns out sucks on 4G (according to the specification it should be much more available on highways, but proved me wrong), so I use GPS offline maps. Thus, you could say I use my phone as a browser, calendar, camera, banking, government, chat app, shopping apps, auth device, navigation. Mainly, it's like a pager.

It's really sad I don't get any reasonable reviews on this site. How am I supposed to decide for this phone based on such mixed reviews on this site?
Example: ""One of the best smartphones, amazing AMOLED screen , excellent battery endurance , very very fast CPU and huge memory, the 50mp camera is awesome.""

""Worst phone ever, the issues :
- UI keep crashing
- Instagram will freeze, or any other application

- Fingerprint reader is not the best, actually it is worse than Galaxy S5

I noticed there is a new feature call AOD - always on display, and it use roughly 3% of battery, so I add it to the list of rules to prolong battery edurance. AFAIK you can disable it in menu - reportedly Samsung phones and this phone have it. If I would not use the MI A1 phone at all - no wifi, no data, no calls, all battery saving rules on - it would last 14 days - that's a maximum I have been able to achieve."
Ciaomi,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,phj,23 Jul 2022,"Hi, I'm planning to buy this phone. Currently have Mi A1, I prefer pure Android and I buy only Qualcomm CPU phones all due to battery endurance.
Here I list options for your battery to last longer:

Switch from 90->60Hz screen; don't switch between 2-3-4G, use only 2G, bc of double signal strength so that your phone saves transmitting energy; battery saver always on, data saver always on, do not have mobile network and WIFI on all the time; buy phone with lowest resolution and adequate battery; use pure Android to avoid ballast processes; use the newest version of Android.

This way I was able to achieve 10 days phone endurance. I do this just because I'm tooo lazy to charge my phone. When I had started to use 4G data phone endurance changed from 10 to 5 days even without mobile data ON, unbelievable. I'm a type of person who does not use phone frequently, only for internet banking, chat apps,... Hopefully, they won't turn off 2G network - I have full signal intensity comparing to 3/4 strength for 3G/4G."

FM radio not starting, automatic brightness is a major fail.. it's not worth the price.
For FM radio you need headphones. Also, by using the app called Activity Launcher you can find hidden FM radio app (com.caf.fmradio) which may be better (it can display RDS and radio text info). About the brightness, it's the best phone I ever had, even on direct sunlight you can see everything clearly (if you enable sun mode in display settings), although you should avoid using your phone on direct sunlight."

You have to have the GetApps (xiaomi's apps store).
Then navigate to section called ""me""
Then you can enable dual apps

If you don't have GetApps on your redmi, then
Change your phone's region to India
Then the GetApps store appear on your apps menu
Then do the same as first instructed
Then again change back to your original region
Dual apps stay on your original region

Troubles with Bluetooth, (on my car, on the soundbar, on a bluetooth speaker) I am listening to music and you open any app and the music stops for a sec, not even the Huawei Mate 20 Lite were this trashy.

Culture of handling tasks is below poor closing apps in background all the time even when it was 1 running in the background. Somehow AnTuTu benchmark was able to squeeze out of it 120000 point's not 250000 as is states on every website I was checking. Putting this all together is better to flush your money down the toilet than spending it on this thing.

Also, M4 Pro is clearly at a different price package than this vanilla Note11 (by at least 25$) from where I came from. Like you said it's based on 11s, this only you can answer yourself whether you need those marginally better performance and camera.

For me this Note11 is worth for it's price as the cheapest tick-it-all device of 2022, except for 5G and gaming capability. If 5G and gaming capability is what you're after, you shouldn't be looking at low mid range phone like this in first place."

RedmiNote11,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,rK%,08 May 2022,"Worst and by far the most expensive redmi phone I have purchased so far !! This phone can't even record a normal 1080p 30fps video without stuttering. Low light renders this camera akin to the camera phones back in the early 2000s. BGMI and other bare essential games lag in this device.
Geekbench score is only 170 for single core and 920 for multi-core and even redmi note 7 had in 3ks.

This phone is nowhere even near what it claims with regards to snapdragon, 6gb+2gb RAM gimmick and 50mp camera gimmick.

Redmi is now seriously giving up on performance to retain its budget segment market that its losing rapidly to other Chinese brands and even samsung.

Times are changing, people are demanding more stressful performance under the same budget which forces the Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi to trade off price with performance to keep the price tag intact. But still for this budget we can get a lot better if we show a little more modesty with the budget."

I haven't experienced this.....I've been using it for a month now
Welcome to the Redmi Note 11 ""Lag"" club guys.

I have found out that after device restarting, device works fine ONLY TILL you take up a phone call. Once you take a phone call, the peak CPU frequency is cut down to half(1.1 Ghz) and it stays there forever till next restart.

This is the reason for all that lag!

I exchanged my first unit thinking it has a H/W problem, and then the issue was prevalent in second unit too. So, it clearly must be MIUI13 issue with CPU frequency scaling. Some issue with calculating application loads to bump peak CPU frequency again.

Check out the video for proof:

but for cons, 680 can't record 4K. the 678 can record 4K. my opinion, you can decide to 678 for perfomance. or 680 for battery life.

Usage: nothing extraordinary. Some photos now and then during daylight. Some games too, but don't want it for gaming.
For me it's more important that the software is well optimized and the MIUI interface runs relatively smoothly for this price range.
5G is not a deal-breaker.

I would say Note 11 makes more sense right? Is the Snapdragon 680 so weak like I see many ppl complaining in the comments?

Tks in advance!"

Hello Bro!
in my opinion Redmi Note 11 is the best in all, I'm using this Phone from last 17 Days and the battery of the Phone easily go on 1.5 days, 90Hdz refresh rate also good and Snapdragon 680 with 6nm process also too optimized but camera quality is just average also I'm not expected a good cameras in this price but daylight photos is good not included night shorts. Also one thing more Xiaomi Remove there all animations from the UI don't worry that feature can't major impact on the system. The design of the Phone is fantastic handy and light weight is perfect. Now I want to tell you the best of the best thing is that the fast charging of 33W charger can charge this phone in just 1 hour and 10 to 15 mints its and 5000 mah battery goes at least more than a day any other questions just email me: solid.salar@gmail.com I will send you all my details with Screen shots thanks."

Right now all of them have very similar prices in my country, but which one is the better value for money?

I see many ppl complaining about the cameras, but I don't expect flagship-level camera phones in 200‚Ç¨ phones, not even close. For me a camera with enough quality for daylight snaps is perfectly fine.

I'd like to have a fluid navigation through the UI, good screen for multimedia, battery for at least 1 day and good network coverage (some phones lack in this area).

Normally I would go for Snapdragon (RN11) due to better support and ISP for cameras, but I know that recently these newer Mediateks have improved a lot.

I've had it for a few days now and I can tell you that performance for day to day tasks is okay. The cameras are fine but nothing to write home about, however, since you said you're not photogenic, you have nothing to worry about. They serve the purpose. The main camera will take excellent pictures of your documents since it's 50MP.
So far I haven't experienced and bugs with the software and MIUI 13 interface is really good with nice features. However it comes with lots of bloatware as expected. The good thing is that many of these can be uninstalled. My plan was to install pixel experience down the road but now I don't see the need to. MIUI works just fine. Hopefully it stays that way."

-Screen is good.
-Battery life is magnificent-getting two days of usage with one charge with 8 to 9h SOT(so about 4-4:30h sot a day).
-Performance-depends.If you are a gamer even my old iPhone 7(a10 chip) is better,but for calls,social,podcasts,navigation,android auto,emails and videos the SD680 is decent.Just a tag slower than my iPhone 12 Mini on normal usage.I hope they won't ruin that with some update.
-Cameras-awful.Quality level is like my old iPhone 5.If not even worse.I would defenetly choose single lens with decent performance than this ""quad ultra AI camera setup"" which is a piece of crap.
-Call quality is decent too.Earpiece is loud,I still hadn't had the chance to test the noice cancelling in the conditions i need it the most.

Anonymous,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,ibj,06 Mar 2022,"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago so here is my conclusion. Display? Simply awesome. AMOLED with a 90hz refresh rate and rarely stumbled upon a lagging issue. Battery? Awesome too. You can use this phone 1 day without charging if you use just regular social media apps but for gaming, it can last 18 hours approximately on my test. Also, the 33w charge is so fast, do heat up a bit while charging but no overheating. Performance? I would say above average but not outstanding. Snapdragon 680 did a great job handling battery life but a slight downgrade when it comes to gaming performance. For CODM i would say it handled pretty well with 4 hours playing straight no noticeable performance drop. For Genshin Impact it's not that good. For starters, it's overheated pretty quickly and when you go to certain places where's there are a lot of particles you would get a pretty noticeable fps drop. That being said Genshin is still playable in this phone though. Just get the better phone if you want to do some heavy gaming for it. Camera? Mediocre. When I use it to shoot some indoor pictures with moody lightning, the image would turn grainy, and the color is just basically gone in terms of saturation. But for outdoors with enough lightning, the image just came out fine. When recording some videos there's a lot of noticeable sharpening which is just painful to look at. Also, the front camera is just okay if you're not photogenic. Pretty horrible I would say. Speaker? Meh it's okay. Pretty loud but the sound is pretty flat. Overall? 8/10."

The body cover provided with the Phone is a real joke as it comes over the screen from 4 sides & Mic issue on VoIP Calls.

What is felt Good?
-Brightness is Great
-Gaming exp is better.
-Low cost with Qualcomm processor.
-Fast charging.
-Better Graphics.
- AOD is awesome but limited options.

I just hope that the MIUI 13 will be slapped on Android 12 very soon üíÉüíÉ"
WisdomousWanderer,11336,Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 ,X06,13 Feb 2022,"I think this phone is getting a lot of undeserved hate and I will list why I think so.

1) Performance: Most people are saying that it only supports 30fps on PUBG etc and that you can't game on this chip and it is unlike redmi. You are right. However, look at the market and you will find xiaomi has no other choice. To keep it under $200 in this market, all you get is a SD 680 or Helio G88.

It is not xiaomi's fault either. It is the chipset makers fault. They are bringing out new chipsets with names that look newer ( G96 vs G95, 680 vs 678, G88 vs G85) but they are nothing more than downgrades or just the same chips with different names. Moreover, they are not selling old chipsets as much due to shortages and new ones are sold at higher prices. Therefore, xiaomi has no choice but to use this.

If Xiaomi used G88, they would have to use emmc 5.1 storage which is quite slow and old and isn't deserving anymore.

2) Camera: People say that camera is not as good. Again, you are right but look deeper. Redmi Note 10 had 4k Video and this does not. SD 680 doesn't support 4k video. Whose fault? Qualcomms, not xiaomi. I can understand that camera quality might not be great but it's the reason why xiaomi has a 108MP 11s for 50$ more for the camera enthusiast. More about this later.

A downgrade over Note 10 series: Correct. Imagine if you were making dinner for recipe. You had to use the same ingredients you used last time. But now the ingredients are expensive but you gotta keep the total cost same. Yes, you can't change math now. So, you gotta use ingredients that are of a lower cost to keep the total cost same. This is the problem these days. All the parts have had their prices increased. And to keep the prices constant, there had to be some downgrades. It is not Xiaomi's fault, it is just how it is.

Basically, point is, the phone is for people who don't care about super enthusiastic photography and don't want to play games. They just want a simple solid phone that has a good battery life, charges fast, has a great display, stereo speakers, overall a good phone. For a good camera and gaming, you can spend $50 more for the 11s, fair enough I'd say. They had to segment after all.

Overall, Xiaomi was forced to make some decisions. Everybody knows that Xiaomi makes about 1% profit on their phones hardware. Thus, they would put the best they can. Which I think they did. 90Hz AMOLED under $200? Oppo gives that for 400+. Basically, xiaomi had set a high standard for themselves over the years but this year, due to external factors they could not live up to their own standards and thus people are bashing them.

You will probably have to wait for the same bang for buck phones that the redmi note 10 series/ Poco X3/F3 series were as supply chain issues look nowhere near to be ending.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong."

It's definitely a good upgrade from Nokia 6.1 Plus.

All of its specs seem good, except for:
1. Processor.
It's notably more powerful than Nokia 6.1 Plus & will easily handle the usage you've described.

But it has *one of the weakest* processors in this price. This phone should be an EASY NO for anyone looking to play games on it.
It's only slightly more powerful than $100-120 phones (Helio G70/G80 phones) - but it's more battery efficient which isn't important as all phones have big batteries now.


2. Selfie Camera.
13MP in this price is not justifiable. Xiaomi already has bad Selfie Cameras in midrange.

I think Redmi Note 9s & Poco X3 NFC have better cameras in similar price (not recommending them).


Note: Xiaomi phones tend to develop display issues in 6-12 months (usually ghost touch issue). It's a common problem.
I've faced this in:
Poco X3 NFC
Poco X3 Pro
But Xiaomi does have overall the best specs among midrange phones right now."

If your priority is gaming, go for Poco X3 pro since its mainly built for gaming with its flagship SD860 SoC so games will be more stable at higher fps. Note 10 Pro cant reach 60fps or even stutters from time to time due to its weak SD732 SoC. But if for media content like Video Photo or watching/streaming Movies/Videos. It has good amoled screen. You can also get Note 11 Pro 5G but its still weaker than Poco X3 Pro."

if this device comes out maybe with a 5G variant later, i consider it better than the redmi note 11 pro vaciant which lacks true dualSIM/SD, and lacks the 3,5mm jack."

Sd 678 and sd680 are very close in benchmarks with up to 7% more power in sd678. But sd680 is better choice for two reasons: it supports high refresh rate of 90 Hz (sd678 does not), and it's much more power efficient becouse it has more modern transistor size, 6nm vs 11nm. And it's going to be cheaper than Redmi Note 10.
Look, Redmi Note 11 is great budget phone. In this price segment no one else is going to give you HRR Amoled screen, stereo speakers, SD chip, full battery in 60 minutes, good cameras... No one, not even close! Just compare what can you get for 180 USD/euros... NOKIA G20, Galaxy M12, Realme 8i, Vivo Y21, Motorola G20, Realme 8, Galaxy A22, Motorola G50, Narzo 30, Motorola G30, and a bunch of Cubot, Blackview, Ulefone extra low end phones...

Is same as to microsd, by removing it just decrease option for user to kept their file, so it pushed to use their cloud service which BS, by claiming ""no one ever used it"", or another BS claim, is funny to see who support of removal of these feature were silent when the vendor is used ""QLC"" as internal, and boasting how faster and huge the internal, the reality those claim are BS, first QLC is bad bad nand type, the durability is abysmal, speed of ufs 1-4 are useless since is using QLC which the controller faking it by used spare free space which cause huge downfall of durability, just kept the gimmick speed of ufs claim, we can called it as pSLC cache. I laught to see the fanboy of marketing defending the vendor who remove microsd and boasted those claim. Is already a lot case dead phone because internal is failing, like poco f3, x3 and other brand too, recent issue is f5. It will become trend because is obsolescence design, whic cause user kept bought new one after the guarantee is expired. They will used inferior tech like oled based display, qlc internal to push their obsolescence design."

SD card is crucial for me. Using SD card not for apps data but for taking pictures and videos, like 1tb SD card is what I use. As a person who uses a lot of space with videos, I'm not gonna pay huge money for cloud storage every month. And the internal phone storage is useless for pics and vids - if the phone dies everythig dies, but with SD card if the phone dies I can take the card out. Internal storage is just good enough for installing apps. Apps data is not so much of a problem, most apps have user data saved on their platform/cloud. At the moment, any other option instead of the SD is just a hustle for people who need it. I understand not providing 3.5mm jack anymore as there is usbc adaptors today for anyone who wants that. But it doesn't take much to provide a hybrid slot for SD card. Sorry, but I don't see any excuse for that from the company's end"

Intel doesn‚Äôt make phone SoC and would likely never will since they already specialize and manufacture chips dedicated to laptops and desktops, competition is also fierce in the phone SoC market making it difficult to enter and thrive in. Also you would have to wait for years in order for a 2nm Chip to exist and be manufactured (TSMC is currently planning on making them at around 2025 though). And with how powerful the chip your hoping for is, phones that would be armed with it would probably cost more than $1000 or so because they would have to accompany it with a monstrous cooling system just to prevent the phone from becoming the sun."

The problem is that the OnePlus 11R's chipset can actually run it's full resolution, while this can not. I can also see the difference between 1080p and resolutions above it, that's why I'm using a phone with a 1440p display, so I believe you on that part.

In my opinion the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is the overall better device, but I think the Zero 30 is a good alternative for people with different needs, or in countries where there is a huge price difference between them.

The Zero 30 also has a 144hz display which is pretty unique for it's price."

Yes, you're right on about the chipset, i couldn't edit my post after I realized my error because there's no edit feature on this blog. But then about the screen, that extra resolution is pretty important to me and trust me I could DEFINITELY see the difference WHEN I used the Oneplus 11R which had a display resolution a little over 1080p side by side with the Vivo v27 which had a 1080p display. That's why I always wished phone manufacturers would sometimes put screens with a resolution a little above 1080p if they can't go all out to 1440p since 1080p is becoming stale to my eyes. I would happily give up a tiny amount of battery life for a little extra crispy display. Plus there's 120 watts to make up for that. All in all, my point still stands that the Infinix zero 30 compared to the Redmi Note 13 pro+ is NOT a better alternative or even a better deal for the person who the redmi is targeted for simply because it can record 4k60fps videos. It might be an alternative if you want to save some money and can deal with all the cutbacks, But it's not an alternative for someone that's looking to upgrade from their older Pro+ redmi Note or just someone looking for ""THE BEST"" midrange phone"" they can buy and those are the people this phone is targeted for."

""Weaker dimensity processor.""

False. They are practically the same, with some aspects of the Dimensity 8020 being better, while some aspects are better when it comes to the Dimensity 7200 Ultra.

https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-compare/mediatek-dimensity-8020-vs-mediatek-dimensity-7200-ultra

""Lower resolution and Pixel density compared to the redmi.""

Pointless, as it's between 1080p and 1440p, meaning it can only do 1080p(+) just like the Zero 30. Especially because the Dimensity 7200 Ultra only supports a maximum display resolution of 2520 x 1080. All that higher resolution does is eats battery life for no reason, potentially taking away one of the biggest adventages of the Redmi, which is it's 4nm chipset, against the 6nm chipset of the Infinix."

I get your point, but it's impossible for the international variant to have lesser specs than this. If they release this the same way the 12 pro+ (which I'm using by the way) was released, then the worst that can happen is a particular color being limited to China, other than that everything else is exactly the same. Also, it's highly unlikely that the infinix will cost HALF the price of the redmi. That's too much of a stretch in my opinion but yeah, if the infinix costs lower than the redmi it will be a good alternative to people who don't mind the extra downsides and want to save some money, that's exactly what the midrange phone segment is about. But the redmi is Definitively better, so it has to cost more. This is not rocket science. And if I wanted to save some money, I will still buy the 13 pro but the non pro+ variant as it still represents a better deal to me than the infinix. But to each his own I guess."

MrMystro,12572,Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ ,XBA,21 Sep 2023,"Redmi has finally Made my Dream phone. All the hate comments here mean nothing to me as I believe they're either from people that don't use xiaomi phones, or people that are still using xiaomi phones from 2 - 5 years ago. I'm currently using the redmi note 12 pro+ and it's the Best phone I've ever used! But the 2 main things I wished my note 12 pro+ had = A curved screen and a leather back(Not a fan of Glass backs actually) is finally here. To be honest I don't even have any ""urgent"" reason to upgrade this phone yet since I'm still enjoying it till date, but the new design will be my deciding factor since every other thing is either the same, or even better. The Dimensity 1080 was a surprisingly HUGE upgrade coming from my Note 10 pro which had a SD 732G processor that was laggy, heats up easily and never felt like I was using 120hz. Switched to the note 12 pro+ and and I understood what 120hz meant. And I'm sure the 7200 Ultra will be even better. Im still running my phone on android 12 and haven't seen ANY REASON whatsoever to update to 13 as my phone runs so smooth m with No bugs whatsoever, why fix it when it ain't broke? As long as it's still running MiUi 14, and it runs perfectly, I'm fine. Updates are extremely overrated in the tech space and People who worry about android updates will always sound funny to me. All in all, I can't wait for the phone to come global as I am DEFINITELY upgrading once I can get my hands on it! Good job Redmi üëç"

Good luck with that :) and is their aim, to make user bought new one on every year.

And is pretty useless if they still use usb 2.0, since the chipset is already supported it. And also removing jackport is annoying, is funny if they used bad dac on it haha

Jus like OnePlus who started simple and then became expensive. The part that hurts is that they all stop including SD Card slots. I would like the opportunity to be able to take my SD Card from one device and put it In another in the event the first device is damaged. That way I won't loose my data.

You dont need powerful chip phone of power hungry apps and games to drain the battery when you have 10 plus hours a day screen on and doing something like watch video or have browser open and view content. Even these budget low end with 6000mAh battery phones dont last over a day doing that.

Well, the cameras on the Motorola are better (bigger main sensor, higher resolution ultrawide + autofocus, 8K video recording and there‚Äôs even autofocus on the celfy camera). It also has an in-display fingerprint reader, if you find it important.

However, the battery lasts longer on the F5 and it should perform a bit better if you intend to keep it for a long time. Besides, the Motorola is over a year old, so less software support left, if you value this.

Then, you should also decide if you prefer the simpler, (near-)stock Android of the Motorola, or the heavily customized Android of Xiaomi‚Äôs MI user interface."

Higher resolution isn't really better if you are playing games as there for it takes more resource on your hardware. Also there is an option to have lower screen resolution but that is something probably nobody is doing as all will run on the resolution the phone was released

We have only one example with Poco to give is that F3 and F4 cause Poco F series have only 5 generations of phones while X series have only 4 generations. Then the M and F series too.

With Xiaomi Redmi series where they release new model every 6 months we can see the pattern more. I use to have Redmi Note 5 AI that come out in spring of 2018 and then in the fall of 2018 come out Note 6 Pro that basically was only screen change to teardrop screen. And in 2019 Note 7 Pro was update one a lot. And then the pattern change again as the Note 8 Pro was with larger screen and better performing cpu with also higher number pixel cameras.

Also F6 should come out in 2024 spring so is that really worth to wait for when people need a phone now ?
When i got my F5 i only waited few months cause i had my eye on X5 Pro and i wanted to see what will F5 be like before i decide. It was good thing that i waited as F5 had the 3.5mm jack return and it was out of the box on Android 13 and not like X5 Pro with Android 12. Also the SD7+ gen 2 was 3rd reason for the F5 favor as the price difference was only around 100 euro.

One more thing to add is that the price of Xiaomi devices have gone a lot up in past 5 years. When Redmi Note 5 Pro was under 200 euro phone then now Redmi note series is already over 300 euro. So waiting for F6 then it's price can also go up cause all the wars in the world we have now that cause all sorts of problems also that affect market probably even worse then the chip shortage."

May i ask how can the phone case affect cooling?
There are case's that help on cooling as they are made in metal for the back side and have the silicon on the sides.
If the case is with silicon alone then it's one more layer that insulates the heat.

Even tough i have no idea what you need to do to get the phone so hot that it become as a problem.
Probably you need to run benchmark under hot sun while have several of them running on the same time and probably also need to play a game too that is heavy on hardware."

A case adds a layer of insulation between your hands and the device, retaining heat for longer, thicker the case, quicker the phone heats up. If its a specially designed case like oppo's Find X5 Pro Ice-Skin case it can reduce temps for a few minutes."

The release of the F6 is simply something worth considering at this point, if one is interested in the F series. Of course, one can always wait a bit more to get something better, but it‚Äôs up to each person‚Äôs decision what to do.

It‚Äôs true that the F4 was a mere refresh of the F3 (the chipset was the same), but that was during a time of worldwide chip shortage and many OEMs were struggling in the mid-range segment. So they ended up doing similar refreshes (some Samsung A series phones were even weaker than the previous ones in the series, at that time).

And, since the top Redmi Note 13 phones got 1220p displays (the F5 Pro even has a 1440p display), it is fair to expect a better screen in the F6, higher touch sampling (even the F4 was superior to the F5 in this regard), a slightly better camera and an even better Snapdragon 7 series chipset, perhaps based on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.

Also, Google is seriously upping the ante in the software support department (starting with the Pixel 8 series), Samsung has started to offer better software support on its A series and even Xiaomi is slowly getting better in this department (not to mention other chinese brands). So, perhaps, the next Poco F series will also see a welcomed software support increase.

These are all things worth putting in the balance when deciding if one should wait for the F6 or not. Once the Redmi Note 13 Turbo will be launched in China (probably early next year), we will have a much better idea of how many of these things will be implemented and if they are worth the wait."

All phone brands have had issues with some models as defective phones.
When will we ever move on from this when we only keep on talking about it ?
There is already X4 and X5 with no issues like the motherboard on x3 pro that was mostly only in India and not in other markets. So it maybe was just a one factory defect that where the phone was made.

There have been a lot worse things with premium brands with high price point phones in the past but we dont talk about it in every of there comments like that is something you can be sure that will happen.

Also Poco X series started with as X2 and then one year later it was X3 and X3 Pro.
I would say that it's not a bad thing when the mistakes happen in first 3 years of the new brand and then dont happen again.

Think of Samsung with exploding batteries on a top end flagship that basically happened when the brand was doing phones for like 20 years so they got so lax that made the type of mistake that actually harmed people and then there battery technology got banned from planes. Having a motherboard issue is really not so big of a deal if you think about it. Also i remember that iphones use to get fat with there batteries.

It's a lot worse when phone cost in the 800 euro range then it happens in the budget range as X3 Pro was a phone that cost 240 euro."

Did you successfully peel off the sticker from the back of your Poco F5? If the answer is yes, did the sticker remain intact?

What did you use while peeling it off other than your nail?

I hate that sticky, disgusting and ugly glue that remains behind after the peeling. It's the only reason why I haven't removed the sticker yet and I don't know what to do about it. I'm definitely not going to leave my home with a phone that reveals it's IMEI."

So the empty box doesn't need to be recycled in a specialist manner??

Do you genuinely think the staff who work at recycling centers are stupid? They work in a highly hazardous environment, a sticker on a phone doesn't add/subtract anything to the precautions they have to constantly take while dismantling products that could potentially become a hand grenade. To rely on a sticker is a death wish!"

You are not thinking straight. The sticker has to be on the outside of the phone to let recycling plants know that the object contains a battery which could explode if it is crushed. The recycling plant is then aware of the danger without spending time taking the phone to pieces to find out.
If you decide to recycle the product then all you have to do is reapply the sticker you kept in the box before disposing of it."

I dont know much about the law too but i dont think the IMEI sticker needs to stay on the phone even when you send it to warranty. It be ok if it is in the box.
Also you just need the check to proof the date you buy the phone and that be all for warranty.

I have went to warranty with one of my phones.

Also i think it's annoying that they stick a sticker on the phone and then have this clue on it that will stick or leave behind paper as when you take the sticker off by aggressively.

I had some clue left on my phone when i got the sticker off.
Also IMEI code on the sticker would wear away if you left it on the phone and when you dont use the case on the phone. The tint would wear off by wear and tear.

Stickers that are for warranty are usually inside the product. Like laptops have them so the warranty repair can see that there was once done some repair for the device that is not official so it's by user and then the warranty is not valid anymore.

But when the sticker is on the case then removing it wont do anything.
It needs to be inside the phone and not outside of the phone."

I live in the EU and I'm acutely aware of the law.

Disposing of electronics with household trash is both illegal and punishable in my country. We are not allowed to throw even a banana skin in the ""normal"" bin, let alone a battery. (I'm not joking).

What I was trying to convey in my previous comment was that Xiaomi had no good reason to attach the picture of a garbage bin on such a prominent place of the phone, and in such a visible way. To some people, this might catch attention in a negative way, irrespective of the EU Law. One can always convey info in a more discrete way. Idiots who decide to break the EU Law, won't be stopped by a picture of a garbage bin on a sticker from Xiaomi.

I know almost nothing about the law. But from the little I know, in order to keep a product ""intact"", the label/sticker must remain on its original ""place"". If you buy a product in my country, and decide to return it for whatever reason, the shop won't take it back if the sticker/label/tag were removed/displaced.

You can of course displace the label that comes with the Poco F5, but what will happen with the warranty then? Displacing a label back and forth is a little risky, it might change its shape and form, that could potentially render the warranty invalid.

You suggested to stick the label on the inside of the box. How come Xiaomi stuck it on the phone itself?? They could have EASILY printed it on the box and saved some money actually. Again, I'm not an expert in law."

'Keep the label intact' is not the same as 'Keep the label in place'. It peels off easily without leaving a mark. Just stick the label on the inside of the box it came in.
The crossed-out wheelie bin symbol on your electrical product, batteries, or their packaging, reminds you that all electrical and electronic products and batteries must be recycled through either a recycling centre or with retailers and is required by EU Law on such products."

I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw IMEI 1/2 printed on the back of my newly purchased Poco F5. I haven't removed the sticker yet, because I currently use the phone as a backup, so it actually doesn't leave my home.

This is what Xiaomi has written on the sticker: ""To protect your consumer rights, please keep this label intact."".

I have a very bad experience with trying to remove stickers in the past. Once I tried to remove a similar sticker from the back of the outer cover of my passport. It almost damaged the biometrics in the passport.

I don't understand why Xiaomi stuck such an ugly sticker on the back of this otherwise beautiful and sexy phone. To add insult to injury, there's an image of a garbage bin on the sticker. I personally don't care about appearances, but in this day and age, where brands and appearances are crucial to a large number of people, the image of a garbage bin on a phone is an EXTREMELY stupid decision."

You have to understand the fact that the F series is meant to offer flagship or near-flagship performance at an affordable price. It is not meant to be the ultimate cameraphone, nor offer other fancy gimmicks. You can certainly find some better cameraphones in this price range, but those offer nowhere near the performance of the F5. And I consider the plastic frame and back to be a good thing, because it keeps the phone lightweight and it is also a personal preference. I wish it had an in-display fimgerprint reader, though."

Open camera app and scroll the menu bar across to 'More' and select 'Edit'
Hold and drag Long Exposure, Panorama, and 64MP icons up to the Start screen and press the tick at the top right of the screen ( you can always put them back afterwards if you wish).
Go back to camera app and select Long Exposure option and you can receive an update that improves the Night shot.
Then do the same with Panorama to receive an update for that.
If you select the 64MP option you now take photos in Ultra HD."

Check out every option in Game Turbo‚Äôs settings, perhaps there is a way to disable that bloatware. Also, try using Game Turbo while offline and see what happens.

By the way, if this ‚ÄûGame Bird‚Äú is an independent application, you can try to disable it from the phone‚Äôs settings. If the option is grayed out, try using a special application, such as ‚ÄûHidden Settings for MIUI‚Äú (search for it on Google Play), which might allow you to disable/remove it.

Also to say that yeah now the price difference have balanced out. When i bough my 8GB RAM version it was 410 euro and it was the cheapest as first week in my country on it's release as other places had it 430 euro and 12GB was 480 euro but in that shop where i got it the 12GB was also with a discount to 450 euro. I later regretting over it a bit but then think of that there is no point for me as i dont much play games or the heavy games at least so 8GB be enough and when in the far future when it gets slow i can have that 5GB virtual RAM added to that 8GB. But as of now i have it turned off.

poco f series has no deadboot issues only in the x and m series
X and M series dont seem to have the issue also as it was only with the X3 and M3 that is 2 years ago. So people got fired for it and they did there best to fix it. Also it's a must to be said that all the issues were only in India market. So probably even the factory that made the India market phones lost some heads or got fined for the damage.

Also there is a saying that we learn from our past mistakes or we need to make mistakes to learn from them.

Just to let people know that Xiaomi is just a bit over decade old brand so to have some issues after 10 years doing the phones is not so bad. Compare to brand like Samsung that had exploding batteries and is old as heck brand with lots of experience doing all types of electronics.

We have seen motherboard issues on all brand so Xiaomi is not different on that part as it's still mass production and there will be always defective examples.

I would say that if motherboard is giving up is a lot better then you have a ticking bomb in your pocket that can do you physical harm is way worse and still people for some reason trust Samsung and dont complain about it.

I dont think that these people who complain about the motherboard issue complain about it cause some models had the issue. They just need to defame cause it's Chinese brand and all the world is scared of China being the next super power that leads the world"

Hello, I was thinking of buying a new phone and I feel that the Poco F5 is close to my ideal o... more
I can tell you from my personal experience of ~3 years of using MIUI that it is a VERY stable UI. My main criticism would have to be that there are some translation errors for my native language, with minor parts which seem machine translated. Also, it takes a bit of adjusting, especially the Settings menu, when coming from a stock or near-stock Android, as the placement of some of the options is different and a bit confusing at first. However, I consider that the complexity of MIUI is a good thing, with lots of parameters to tweak.

As for the battery, there are lots of factors which can influence its performance, including, but not limited to: temperature, screen refresh rate, screen brightness, signal quality (the better the signal, the less electrical current is being used), using the GPS, using 5G, background tasks, the type of content which is being displayed and so on. For day-to-day intents and purposes, I‚Äôd say to trust the GSMArena battery tests.

Go for it!"

The MIUI issues people talk about is more of there own preferences. When they have been on Samsung OneUI for long period of time then all UI for them sux. Or being on oneplus or something. The fact that the poco is Chinese is already a problem for some people so they need to defame it.

RamairoZurich,12258,Xiaomi Poco F5 ,8xP,19 Sep 2023,"Hello, I was thinking of buying a new phone and I feel that the Poco F5 is close to my ideal of a near-perfect phone. I don't care about the build design, the waterproof certification, the quality of the speakers, the quality of the cameras (I would even remove them to save price if I could). What I do care about is that it has a good battery, a decent AMOLED screen, good performance, that it has the 3.5mm jack and that it has the fingerprint detector on the side. I feel that the Poco F5 meets all these requirements (except in the battery section, since I have read quite diverse opinions, from the fact that it lasts more than 10 hours of active screen to the battery draining super fast), but what I find brakes is the operating system. Is Miui really that bad and buggy? Or did it simply become a meme to mock the flaws of previous versions of Miui? I come from Motorola, which has a mostly clean system, but I wouldn't mind if the system was highly customizable. What would bother me would be if it failed all the time. So far the only bugs I've heard are that pocket mode doesn't work and the notification bar when listening to music looks a bit bad, as if it doesn't let you see the commands to change music correctly. Are these the types of errors I can find? Or are there more serious things that cause the phone's fluidity to be lost?

As for custom roms, I have no knowledge on the subject and I have heard that the cell phone can have a hard brick and become unusable. Also, I don't know what the security issue is like with that type of things (emails, passwords, Google services, streaming services, banking apps, etc.)

hey guys, can you tell me about the cons of this phone and is there any issue with software ?
Look the F5 up from a site kimovil and in there are people in all languages commenting pros and cons and you can press translate on each comment

All these pros and cons are same for each phone and brand comments where people have diverse view points of cons and pros to each brand phones comments.
Search videos of the phone from youtube to see there advertising point of view of pros and cons. You can also search the phone name and cons for videos where they talk about them that is when the con really is a con for the phone.

In the end of the day it's what you want from the phone.
I wanted performance even tough i dont play games a lot but i need performance.
Also i wanted to have 3.5mm jack for sure cause i have something 10 years old wired headphones i have used with my previous phones.
Also i wanted AMOLED screen cause i have never had one for anything so for experience sake i needed it.

I have all of that from this F5 8GB RAM 256GB Storage phone
There is also 5GB virtual storage RAM but i have it turned off. If it helps in any way for performance then maybe after 4-5 years i can turn it on.
Camera is good middle class camera and well i dont do much pictures at all ever.
I use it more as a tool for magnification glass to read small text or something.

So you just need to understand what is your budget and what you desire to have on your next phone. F5 is a good choice if camera is not a priority and want performance for games that last you for 5 to 10 years then Poco F5 is for you
All phones have pros and cons but for 400 euro phone you cant expect it to have all the bling as they need to cut the cost on a lot of things so you can have the flagship performance on middle class priced phone"

If you look for performance first and dont care much about the camera even tough the camera is good enough in the middle class phones and so in this one too.

I dont think there will come anything better then this in this price range for this year and for the start of next year like 4 months in. F6 maybe be like F4 was to F3 as not a big update.

As of now there is nothing in the market for Global market as the European market that is better then this. Maybe some brands have better camera but none have better performance."

The best performance is on the Poco F5, with insignificant GPU throttling. The Nord 3 is somewhat close, but GSMArena‚Äôs tests showed that the GPU throttles to ~55% of its peak performance. The Edge 40 is considerably weaker."

He said the camera is trash on the F5 but wants to get good camera phone and then shows some one and half year old Realme phone that have it's good camera and SD 8 Gen 1 in it that is also good enough for gaming. But he wants all of that in the 400 dollar range. So use your brain and think about it on your own. There are no good camera phones in 400 dollars range with high performance also. Poco is a brand that makes phones for performance as priority number 1 and camera is decent middle class. I own the F5 and i can give advice to people on that phone from my own experience with it. But you cant have good camera phone and have good performance too for 400 euro if the phone is not at least 2-3 years old but by then the camera is already middle class and performance is also top of the middle class.

In 400 dollar range you can only pick one and that is good camera phone and middle class performance or good performance and not so good camera"

Poco f5 man. If you are confused try to watch GsmArena reviews for these phones. I just watch them and i can sai GT2 pro its low performance for an snapdragon 8+ gen 1 phone. In AnTuTu v9 Poco f5 have 930000 points and Realme GT2 pro have 960000, in Geekbenck Poco f5 beats Gt2 and f5 have more fps in benckmarks. Poco f5 have much good battery life. Poco have an better screen. Becouse f5 has been launched with Android 13 and Gt2 with Android 12, Poco have one more year of software updates becouse Gt2 used one of them software updates for update to Android 13. Poco have much low overheating and better stability. About cameras in GsmArena review they said that Poco f5 cameras are good for this price except night mode. If you can buy an new Poco you shoud buy it especialy when you can buy 12GB RAM version and you actualy have 7GB of digitaly RAM and thats mean 19GB( you need to motive that digitaly RAM are slower than usualy RAM).

Nope. Changing it to 60Hz reduced the heating and drain, I tried it and it doubled my battery life. I only use the 120Hz when a game supports a high refresh rate now. the 120 Hz activates both in Browser and FB so changing it to 60Hz really helped. Video Recording at the Highest Settings for several minutes does heat it up (like every phone ever). You can confirm it with the monitor tools inside the phone and a thermal monitoring device. What's good about is the temperature difference internally and externally isn't as high due to it's large cooling system unlike other phones which have high internal temperature and low outside temperature."

It's probably your screen addiction issue why your battery drains a lot.

Also why the heck you need a phone cooler for video recording ?
I cant imagine what does the phone do on just video recording on high res or what ever.

Gaming is different as the game is software that needs to create texture that you can see on the screen and do it in high frames per second rate. Also games use internet so the modem needs to work more. There are lots of things that take more power on games to make heat then there is for filming something."

I have 8GB version and when i bought the phone i was thinking to get the 12GB version as it didnt cost that much more but still i went with the 8GB version as i dont play much games and especially the games that need good performance out of the phone.

Now i think that 12GB would of been better cause when we now look new phones coming out there be like 8GB ram as standard or something while also have 16GB and 24GB options.
Seems like the software optimization gets so lazy that they just dont care if the brands give them so much ram to play with.

But still i dont think that even for next 5 years you need more then 8GB ram as still the majority of market is like 4-6GB ram when you look the phones that cost like 150 euro to 450 euro that is the majority of world market phones and also there performance that is maybe half of what you get with 7+ Gen 2

So if you doubt then probably best to go with 12GB version and then dont need to think what if"

You have X3 Pro and ask the questions. Is your x3 Pro have these issues you asking for ???

If your X3 Pro dont have the issues then you should have the proof and answers you asking for. as the X3 Pro is the phone that had the motherboard issues and it was only in India market. Also if you have the X3 Pro and dont have issues with it then why do you believe there be issues with newer models ? I dont know any of the problems ever have been on Poco F series. Also X3 Pro was like 240 euro phone when it was new so it was crazy cheap at the time 2 years ago.

Also my comment to you probably useless cause you probably wont read anyways as there are over 40 pages of comments and you didnt go trough any of them to see this question asked multiple times. Never mind that it takes like half a year time before it be widely known that there are issues on any new phone from any brand."

My first try was with Asus Nexus 7 2013 7inch tablet that ended with kitkat 4.4 something and i went with custom os for it and ended around 6 or 7 as when i stopped using it.
My last phone as redmi note 5 ai dual cam i got only 18 months of updates of any kind but that phone cost only 170 euro so that was good enough. I had like 5 years in use so 3.5 years after last update i was on android 9 and there is no difference in your daily dealings on my phone to notice any difference. In the end of the day it's just a number as it does not mean apps lose support on them. Before Android 16 i wont care about custom OS as F5 should end like Android 15 and warranty in Europe is 2 years mandatory for electronics

As then be good time to update your phone to a new OS skin and the phone feels like new again as a lot to discover."

Also kind of pointless to buy F4 now when it's already over year old and wont have much updates left as we know that from China brands there is not a lot of hope to get a lot of updates if updates are important for you.

Also F5 have 3.5mm jack that the F4 dont have. F5 is a bit smaller and lighter then F4 and have a bit larger battery then F4

I tough you had other phones then Redmi 5 Plus and X3 Pro as you said in your comment that you previously mentioned.

If you previously have mentioned in a comments that would make sense in that case but from your post as you wrote i got it that you had some other phones then x3 pro and redmi 5 plus.

I would think there is nothing much difference from OS of x3 pro to F5 as both run on same Poco MIUI that should be the stripped version of MIUI or at least that was how they advertised the Pocophone F1 back in the day they release it 5 years ago.

I would recommend this F5 as it's best you can get for that price if you are in to gaming and play heavy games. For other reasons like browsing the internet and calls you dont really need better then something like Poco M6 5G

F5 also have decent camera for middle class phone. Comparing it with other phones like Galaxy A54 that have it's camera with filters that make the picture more brighter or more contrast then thats more of a user preference. I dont much care for camera as the amount of pictures i make or what quality i look for then even my last Redmi note 5 ai dual cam did the job well and i were satisfied with it. Well yeah i would of wanted the camera had the slow motion feature like 960fps for some fun and as it only have 240fps was a bit let down but then again not a big deal. To be honest i dont understand the point of 240fps as it's not slow enough to make sense to even have it"

i‚Äôm a bit worried about miui, we all know one ui is so much better
We all know people talk a lot.
I have no personal experience with any specific os skin.
What makes one ui better or worse is beyond me. Why is MIUI bad is also something i dont understand.
People keep on talking that it's bad for some reason but never elaborate on that why and what exactly is bad.
I dont make much of a difference in any Android phone as all new things take time to get use to them. With all new phones going with new OS will not be good experience the first few weeks or months. Especially when you are with one phone for 5 years and miss out on 4 android updates. I had Android 9 and something MIUI 12 like for 3 and half years and now i have android 13 and miui 14. There are lots of new things i didnt have before and well it's mostly cause it's a new phone that also have lots of new features and a lot more powerful. Going from 130k antutu v9 bench score phone to a 930k bench score should have something to do with that.

All skins have there own flaws and good points and to say one is better then other is totally personal. Some just hate everything Xiaomi makes for what ever reason behind it.

And to say it as all know that oneui is better then miui is only the biggest nerds in the market who have like 10 different phones a month"

Depends on your needs. If you need good cameras and basically most other aspects, go with the s21+. The poco f5 is only really a good choice if you play mobile games since the s21 line up tends to overheat and throttle a lot.

So what that your Romanian ? I learned English trough internet and TV shows/Movies when i was a kid. Writing more from internet as i didnt have English in school or at least at the point where i didnt know much about the language.

Is being a Romanian some excuse for not being educated ? I am from Baltics that also is not English as native language. It's just weird to see people comment on sites with language translators while have no clue in to what the translator is translating. Cant correct when wrong and so on. I only use translator when i seek for some specific work what i dont know how to write as it's totally different in writing form then how the word sound"

Is it worth upgrading from Poco F3 to F5 or F5 pro
Give us a reason why you want to upgrade a phone then we can give you the answer on is it worth or not to upgrade.

Based on just F3 that still is very powerful phone i dont see a point to upgrade for the performance sakes. If you want faster charging speed and larger battery then maybe but even that is not worth it. Want a better camera then you should probably look for some flagship phones that are made as camera first and not Poco that is performance first"

It's worth upgrading the x3 gt to this
It's not worth to buy a new phone in the first place if you have X3 GT that is only like 2 years old.

What is your reason on wanting new phone ? Is the X3 GT broken in some ways ?
I would think it should still last 3 or more years and only thing that can give up on is battery life. Performance wise it should still be good even after 5 to 10 years from now as it is around 580k on Antutu v9 score that is around SD778 range.

Basically only worth to buy F5 now is if you want it for specific games that need a lot of resource on hardware to run on high fps that are maybe only few games in the market as of now what we can count on one hand fingers and have fingers left too.

Something like Genshin that i have heard wants a lot of power from your device to run on high fps. I dont know much about games on phones but still i dont see why would anything change in 5 years or more in gaming where all games want super computers to run them when as of now 300-400k Antutu v9 score phones are in the majority of the market with all the Dimensity 700/800 and the rebranded 4 digits numbers of them and then Helio G8x and 9x plus on the snapdragon there is these SD695/480/4gen1/4gen2 and the like plus even SD778/782/870 that also are a lot in the market but not as much as the earlier mentioned. While these are more higher end middle class chips with higher price on the phones too.

So are you bored of your phone and just need a new toy ? I dont really understand the reason.

Pretty much what i see in change with this is that you get 120Hz AMOLED screen while you have LCD 120Hz screen and chip from Dimensity 1100 to SD 7+ Gen 2.
Other then that maybe a bit improvement on camera but not so much. And rest is pretty much same. Actually one more thing to add X3 GT dont have 3.5mm jack but that is simple fix to just buy the converter that is usb-c to 3.5mm

To be honest i have like 2 esternal headphones sound cards as i got one with creative sound blaster headset and other one was Logitech so i need like only usb to usb-c converter to make it work while that lose the headphones microphone if the headphones dont have 2 plugs as one for sound and other for microphone"

I found that if I turned off Pocket mode in the settings then it works perfectly, no accidental unlocks and touches when in my pocket. So remember turn it OFF to make it work lol.

And no, apps don't close so quickly or refresh at all when switching, and I only have 8GB, something must be wrong with yours. Look at the A54 vs Poco F5 comparison on youtube by Nick Ackerman, F5 holds more apps on switching than the A54.

No notification delay on mine, all the common apps arrive on time, Gmail receives notifications faster than my PC, I hear it notify first on the phone, but you have to enable for all labels in Gmail's settings. So you probably didn't set it properly."

Positives:
Nice screen quality and size
Nice design that's very comfortable to hold and use
Fingerprint reader is insanely fast and accurate
Has a proximity sensor (although Pocket mode is still broken).
Fast processor
Seems to run cool

Negatives:
All software really.
MIUI is bad, as explained below.
The pocket mode still doesn't work many months later. Apparently a fix has only just arrived in the Chinese ROM now, almost half a year since Note 12 turbo release... Ridiculous...
Apps are constantly closed in the background despite lots of free RAM remaining out of the 12GB. All power saving options etc are turned off for these apps. To compare directly Oxygen OS can keep apps running all day if there is enough RAM.
Notifications are heavily delayed sometimes, again despite removing battery saving.

Very strange... I must have been really lucky I guess. From countless speakers and headphones I've never had this occur although I don't typically listen to really loud levels either.

It's true that I can probably send this in for repair but considering how much hassle that is and that I will have to be without a phone for who knows how many weeks... I'm just not going to bother to be honest. The ""solution"" I found is to enable Mono sound and move the channel balance all the way to the Left (the non distorted channel) from the Accessibility menu. It's annoying because when I want to listen to music via headphones I need to go into the menu again and revert to default setting but I can live with it. For all other uses of the speakers I don't find a big problem, like I said the stereo speakers never sounded that great on this phone anyway (with or without Dolby Atmos) so for the occasional YouTube video or social media the sound from one speaker in mono is okay. I will probably seek out a local repair centre one day that can replace the damaged bottom speaker but I'm in no rush to do that. The replacement part itself is very cheap and already available online...

Sending it to Xiaomi just doesn't seem plausible to me, I live in Bulgaria where this phone isn't even available officially for sale which probably means that whatever authorised Xiaomi repair centre we have (if we even have one) will not want to deal with it."

I'm presuming it was the moisture as really not sure what else it can be. I've had 5 different phones in the past I've done this with and I've never had any issues... Not like all of them have been flagships either. It is only the bottom speaker that sounds distorted, the top one plays fine still..

Either way if a phone's speakers can be so badly damaged by playing certain frequencies then that is a badly designed phone period. The other option is that the phone's speakers have always sounded so bad and I've only just noticed how bad they actually are. They're definitely no way near as good as my LG G7 in terms of fidelity or volume but what I'm hearing on the F5 is actual distortion and certain higher frequencies exhibit it very badly. I tried playing with the EQ settings and nothing can be done. Definitely can't bother with sending it back for repair or w/e, it's my first Xiaomi phone so wasn't expecting miracles but that is a rather lame hardware fault that developed basically out of nowhere and it doesn't inspire me with much confidence in buying another of their phones in future.

My phone is the 12GB ram version and I always have between 6 and 7GB free ram so that shouldn't be a problem for the notifications. They work fine most times but not always, just inconsistent performance in that regards."

On my F5 i have all apps notifications turned off and some i even uninstalled.
Only apps i care to have notifications are messenger like apps and the Pi Coin mining app even tough i have not a lot of hope that Pi Coin will have any value or be usable but it wont take a lot out of my phone performance and it's not hard to click on a button once in a day.

Even if the Pi coin be like around 20 euro a coin i have something 300-400 of them so maybe enough to get me a free new desktop computer that last me next 10 years so 100 pi coins be around 2000 euro then that get me some really good PC even tough i wont spend more then 1000 on a PC anyways"

Valid points. Well, one thing I don't like on the 12P5G is the lack of EIS on 4K video, and the X5 Pro does have EIS at 4K. You only get the basic OIS but that is mostly suited for photography. Any moderate movement (like walking) will make your video quite shaky. You'll need to lower resolution to 1080p/30fps to trigger EIS.
On the other aspects, yeah I think the Redmi has a better main sensor overall. You can hit me up on the comments over there if you like, I think this section should be for the F5."

It has always been the story every time a new Xiaomi, Redmi or Poco phone comes out. They entice us with lovely specs and affordable prices. But the novelty runs out when you realize that down the line newer and better (and roughly the same or slightly more expensive) devices comes out with more updated OS and monthly updates since Day 1 and your Xiaomi phone gets left in the dust pretty quickly with limited software updates.

As I mentioned I don't concentrate too much on the raw power of the SoC tho that's only an advantage and not a deal breaker. I also look at real life usage and not on stats or benchmarks.
If the X5 pro has good EIS on the main and selfie cameras on all modes then I'm fine with that.
If it has good but not overly contrasty photos then I'm fine with that.
If the skin tones are spot on and not ""hit or miss"" then I'm fine with that.
if it handles better in direct sunlight and an efficient dynamic range rendering i'm fine with that.
If the speakers are loud, well-rounded, clear, solid-sounding with a bit of bass then i'm fine with that.
If the camera focuses faster than the Redmi Note 12 Pro then i'm fine with that.
But based on my research 4 out of 6 of the above issues i've raised the X5 Pro is not as good as the Redmi Note 12 Pro.
Again, i'm happy to be proven wrong here please."

I think the delayed notifications are part of the miui problem as i had it also on my old redmi note 5 ai dual cam. Like facebook messenger time to time delayed messages from friends like day later or hours later.

With this F5 i experience the delayed notification on the Pi coin mining app.
That annoyed me on redmi phone as it only vibrated for the notification. Basically only app i want that notify me when is the time to press the button once in a day so it will start mining.

the more annoying notifications were miui apps like themes that had nothing in them but the app update all the time and then give laud sound at like 3 or 4 at nigh that wakes me up from sleeping"

That‚Äôs a bit strange to only have damaged speakers and nothing else. Are you sure that it was the moisture‚Äôs fault? Because speakers can get damaged from playing certain frequencies too loud. I recommend that you test to see if both of them are damaged, or just one of them. If it‚Äôs both of them in equal manner, I highly doubt that moisture is the culprit.

Also, speaking of delayed notifications, do you have the 8GB version or the 12GB version?"

The DND feature sometimes still plays sound from WhatsApp when it's on, kinda defeats the purpose of it.

Biggest problem I have is with the build quality though... I brought my phone to my bathroom to play music while showering once, no water has touched the phone, no splashes or drops even. Now the speakers sounds like a distorted mess on any sound that is more high pitched than normal, certain songs sound really bad at high volumes. Even the included ringtone ""Acoustic Guitar"" has a horrible bitting bright sound and clipping distortion everywhere. So a phone that is supposedly IP53 certified couldn't handle a bit of moisture? Very reassuring. It has been more than 24 hours since then so the speakers should be fully dried by now, I'm fairly convinced it's permanently damaged. Tried all the usual ""Speaker cleaner"" apps so many times and nothing changed. Not that the SQ through the speakers was anything special anyway, just ridiculous that now it's even worse from just simply being in the 'close' vicinity of water. I guess keep this phone well away from water or getting wet if you want your speakers to sound normal lol"

Search reviews about both of them. While the 12 Pro has a slight advantage in the main camera, the real difference isn't big, really. And how much of a difference OIS makes depends on specific scenarios. Poco's Snapdragon 778 also has a bit more power in multicore CPU tasks.

I despise Samsung phones for mainly these: ancient slow charging, poor Android gestures compatibility when a third-party launcher is installed, slow performance due to One UI, the insistence of using their Exynos chips elsewhere and the ultra slow fingerprint sensor. Not too bothered by the lack of 3.5mm jack TBH. This is the reason why i kept coming back to a Xiaomi phone. Along with F5, the other phones that have Snapdragon are the X5 Pro, Redmi Note 12 5G and the 12T Pro which i can't afford. And what I can afford right now is a Redmi Note 12 Pro, X5 Pro or an older Galaxy S21 FE and perhaps an A54.
Based on my research and the need to save money i'm gearing to wards the Note 12 Pro (than the ""Plus"" version for many reasons) than the rest. I only take photos for food, when out & about with my significant other and when travelling abroad for holiday which happens not very often. Any thoughts?"

On the same price point as F5 you wont get any phone that has a lot better camera on them.

I cant even think what phone is better then this on this price range. People talk about Samsung A54 but all that A54 give you is just software support for 4 OS updates and 5 years of security updates while performance is nothing special over other in the market that is cheaper like phones with SD778

F5 dont have microSd that the A54 have but that is not a big deal for me as i prefer 3.5mm jack over microSD every day of a week. I also got a solution for that microsd to buy 2TB usb flash drive that was like 5 euro from Xiaomi and 5in1 dongle that converts usb 3.0 to type-c and also have the microsd and the larger storage card slot while also have the micro usb and just usb plug that also cost like 5 euro.

Moving like 1GB of files once in a month to usb flash drive wont take that much time to have backup of your videos and pictures to keep the phone cleaner without the need to hold your life on it that can be lost for losing the phone or if something happens to the phone."

It's what you want for the phone is important. For me i dont even look Samsung A 54 cause it dont have 3.5mm jack and S21 FE is not for me cause it's a large phone and also no 3.5mm jack. S22 probably have drop it's price to around 500 euro and it's in smaller size that i would care for and then dont much care for the part that the phone dont have 3.5mm jack.

Only good thing about Samsung is that it's updates on android is 4 of them and 5 years of security updates but then again if that would be my first priority then i still would go with Xiaomi phones with SnapDragon chip cause with that i can unlock the phone and install custom android on it that will have longer period of android updates and security updates.

Other then that A54 maybe have better camera then Poco F5 but then again i watched videos and it looks like Samsung just use contrast filtering on pictures that brightens up the colors like green pops up more and so on. It's all user preference on that part and i cant say one is better over other. I basically dont much use camera on a phone.

I mostly use phone camera in food shops to read the ingredients cause these are in so small text that i cant see them so i make a picture and zoom in as my hands are shaking too so i cant just zoom in to read the text."

It's all downgrade on everything going from OnePlus 10T that isn't even 1 year old. Why even look for replacing it ? Basically going from flagship to middle class with everything you mentioned. Poco F5 is best out of them but it's still middle range price phone that is made for performance first so the camera on it is ok but nothing special. Everything is basically to cut the price down. Redmi Note Series use to be budget middle class that now is nothing special middle class where i take Samsung A54 or 34 over the Redmi note series. X5 Pro is also performance first as it's still a Poco brand that is doing performance for people who want to play games and can afford to buy them over brand phones with same hardware performance for a lot lower price.

I would say in your case it's wasted money as it wont improve anything for you. I dont even understand the point to buy phones every after half a year to a year."

How do you explain the build quality ?
Both phones are plastic as materials so what makes one better in build quality then other ?
12T seems to just have better camera and better screen as higher resolution screen.
Also faster charger as F5 have 67W while 12T have 120W

While F5 out of the box is on Android 13 and the 12T is on 12 so i dont know how well the 12T be updates on software over Poco F5"

Why would Neo 7 Pro have better camera then just average when it should be around same price point or lower ? Why didnt you go with F5 Pro that have better screen with higher resolution and also 8K recording and also around the price of that Neo 7 Pro ?

Also weird to buy a phone and then less then a month just sell it and lose like 100 euro or more from the phone cause it's used now and the value drops. Even when you have the phone still in the box and have the elastic film on it then it be still second hand cause your not retailer and you cant give the warranty with the phone"

You know that Redmi Note 12 Pro has IMX 766, same as on A54 and Nothing (1) right? then why is the out put from Redmi worse than A54/Nothing 1?

Don't compare it to Poco F5 because F5 has Omnivision, it is different. I am comparing phones with the same sensor. You can see from results and others complains that Note 12 Pro results is subpar compared to A54/Nothing 1 with the same sensor.

On top of that you only have Dimensity 1080 on Note 12 Pro and Pro+. That package combination isn't worth it even though you have the best looking screen. And you only get Android 12 out of the box, means one less android update. So unless Note 12 Pro/Pro+ is much cheaper than the F5, it is not worth buying at all."

Can you please explain what you mean with ""you can just feel poco f5 just cheap from the moment you touch the screen with your finger""?

I use Poco F3 and Poco X4 GT. I don't feel the screens are cheap, far from it actually. Even though the X4 has LCD panel, , but I wouldn't dare calling it ""cheap""...

I played with some cheap phones in the past out of curiosity, and I can assure you that F3/X4 GT are way, WAY, far from being felt cheap. Poco F5 is just an improved iteration of F3/F4.

I'm waiting for my F5 to be delivered, so I haven't played with it yet. You could certainly be right/wrong in your subjective perception. It's an open question for me at this moment.

I'm stunned by what people in this forum expect to get from a phone that cost less than Euro 500. Sometimes I get the impression people expect a camera that resembles the Hubble telescope. I don't know whether to laugh or cry at some of the comments. I don't understand why all these people can't just buy a decent camera instead of the constant and endless whining...

I would say it's way better then have large island bump on the rear and on top of that bump there will be cameras that also stick out of the bump is way more ugly then just 3 dots coming out of the rear.

If you want a different color for the phone then just buy case for it as there are slim cases like that or just wrap the phone with vinyl and then have what ever paint job you like on it.

Seriously like the things to complain about design and color where as design is only the cameras as rest is same on every phone and color of the phone is also like that. As long as phone have black color i just dont care"

Maybe you go buy a brain first. Like seriously do your research. X3 Pro only out of all Poco phones have had issues with motherboard and even on that in mostly only in India market.

Just read the comments in here that have said this same countless of times. And stop making comments like i have heard there are flying elephants going around.

We all know Samsung have had issues with exploding batteries in the past or iphones have made updates that slow your phone down so you buy new model of there phones.

Your kind are the most annoying bunch that have no brain cells to rub against each other to be able to use to think or do your own research.

Are you even smart enough to make difference what is a troll and what is a not ? These people who talk about motherboard issues are trolls and just have the need to defame every model for next 10 years that come out of Poco brand cause it's Chinese brand and they dare to have problems with motherboard with only one model in there lineup 2 years ago. Now all the rumors are taken like it's pure gold as real as possible and no need to think on your own. Just go around tech sites and leave comments of hearing there are flying elephants all around us and world is coming to and end of overflowing flying elephants."

My poco f1 bought on oct 2018 still usable till today, can play GI medium setting without problem, downside only the storage 64gb.

Only poco x3 pro has sudden death issue, but I think its faulty is the design, xiaomi only place snap 860 in poco x3 NFC without better cooling system."

I'm confused about choosing between F5 or Galaxy A54
What is there to be confused at ? Want long term updates as your main thing then go with A54. Want a phone that last you long in performance wise then pick F5
Want to have MicroSD slot then pick A54 but when you want to have 3.5mm jack then F5

Antutu v9 Benchmark score is for gaming mostly to know how good the chip are.
A54 - 506678
F5 - 931174

Also F5 have 67W charging speed and charger in the box while A54 have only 25W charging and no charger in the box. A54 is only 3mm shorter then F5 but also is 21g heavier then F5

So i would think no brainer is to go with F5 as A54 dont have much to compete with this other then software updates but then again you can install custom rom on F5 and get more updates then A54 in the long run."

It may also be that the SD860 was the problem cause we didnt see that chip on a lot of devices after X3 Pro and some Redmi Pad or Xiaomi Pad after that phone.

Maybe also the cause why the phone was so cheap as 240 euro and have SD8 series chip that was still basically a flagship chip even tough old chip and renamed or something but still at that price there was nothing that compete with it on the market"

I see people hear a lot of things in comments all around. I see them as trolls who complain about motherboard issues that only happened to X3 Pro and was mostly in India only.

Maybe India market phones have issues but so far i have not heard any issues for Europe market. My F5 Europe version with 8/256 dont have any technical issues so far.

Just saying there are people who complain and talk false information cause they have heard something and think it's best to say i have heard my self also and complain about it in a tech site comments. There are also people who ask motherboard issues cause you know X3 Pro 2 years ago had the issues in India market a lot so must be now expected that all F series that have not had any of these issues and from X4 onward was not on even X series.
Samsung use to have battery exploding issue and there for some battery types got banned for air travel. I would say a lot worse issue then few heavy user phones motherboards give up-
We see them complainers cause it's China brand and we need to judge them based on that.
China is evil you know even tough civilians are same like we are lucked under government who controls you in different ways. Under different titles that dont much mean anything."

I got 8/256 version and bought it for 410 euro on it's first week of release in EU.
I have the 2 year warranty cause i got it from my country local shop as all electronics have 2 years warranty in EU as minimum. The shop i bought the phone for needs to play by EU rules with the warranty so it wont matter is the brand it's self dont give more then 1 year warranty as the shop needs to give it from the date you receive the device.

No headphones in the box for me and i am not expecting even to get them. To have silicon case and charger in the box is already big deal for me. I dont even remember the last time i got headphones with a phone as that must be something 20 years ago maybe,

Usually retailers do it with bundle to sell the phones more to fool people with the manipulative word FREE in it while the bundle usually is more expensive cause the headphones are then in the price. One of my friends brag about year ago when he bought S22 that he got smart watch for free while paid 850 euro for the bundle as without the smart watch the phone was a bit under 700 euro while the smart watch was 150 euro too so it was added in the price as bundle so you wont get anything for free but cause there is the word free it fools people to think that is the case."

Where exactly did you buy it from?

Some EU outlets include, among other things, a headphones in the standard retail box, in addition to 2 - 3 years warranty, which is rather unheard of when it comes to Xiaomi phones. Xiaomi has historically been reluctant and dislikes offering EU style warranty. I'm both positively surprised and impressed by how these outlets managed to force Xiaomi adhere to EU law.

I seldom watch those Indian reviews on YouTube, because I don't understand ""jabrabadaba"". However, If I get some free time in the future, I might attend a course in Indian English, because learning it could facilitate communication with our brothers and sisters in the Southern Hemisphere. Learning the accent is not the only challenge, you also have to learn how to shake your head simultaneously in a highly characteristic fashion while talking, believe me when I say it's not easy. If you don't shake your head at a certain pace and direction, they won't understand what you're trying to communicate, even if your verbal communication is perfect. So you can't just shake your head sporadically, at least not in an Indian restaurant, because your shaking monster will determine how much hot chili they will put in your ordered food. All this explains why I don't watch Indian reviews on YouTube."

Buying out side of EU you get the TAX and that makes the phone cost same as you get from EU shops.
There is youtube that is full of phone reviews just type ""Poco F5"" in the search and go trough a lot of it as most are India language reviews where they jabrabadaba and some go mix in english but there are also full english reviews. There are even durability test videos of it.

What you get in the box is 67W charger, 1M long cable for charging and silicon case that is good enough so you dont need to buy something different. Case goes over camera and over screen that 0.3 or 0.5mm that all cases have and the phone should have some screen film on the screen from factory. I am not sure as i have not tested to see is there a film to scratch some corner of the screen to peal it of and then it wont stick back or get some dust under it or what ever problems that usually happens with that type of action.

I dont know any phone brand that give you protective glass with the phone and now days to get headphones with the phone is only in a bundle deal as these days are long gone where phones come with headphones. To have case in the box is already a good thing and then to have charger in the box is start to be rare and especially fast charger like this 67W

Unboxing videos should show you want you get. It's better to go to watch some video reviews done by people who do loads of these reviews. There was even one video where F5 camera was compared to iphone 13 max ultra or something like that.

I tried the sound on some dnb to see the vibration of sound. The speakers just make a lot of noise at max and yes it feels some vibration close to the speaker holes.

My old Redmi note 5 ai dual cam audio didnt go that high on the one speaker it had and also it's body is in Aluminum

And yes the rear cover have some flex on pressing lightly to feel that there is some space under it that is probably good for cooling the phone so your body heat wont make the inside of the phone hotter. But for that i cant say it's like bad build quality

Just the way you explain the build quality is weird that surface of the rear is fingerprint magnet. I would think all phones that even have glass backs have it as fingerprint magnet.

And for the sound that makes a bit of vibration close to speakers is more of the sound waves and the camber for speakers. With powerful speakers the vibration is expected especially on plastic phones. You compare iphone that has metal body to plastic is unfair yes. Also the edges of the phone are not rounded cant be said it's bad build quality as thats just the design. Easy to fix is to get a case for the phone that has rounded edge.

Build quality means how the phone is built. Like is there large caps between screen and the body or when you shake the phone then the inside hardware is lose that you hear it go around in it. Or the phone frame is weak so the phone can be bent in half like in these phone abuse tests where even iphones bent in half and broke on the antennae lines

Bend easly? What do you mean by that? Like as in trying to bend it with both hands? As for the back yes the plastic if pushed down you can see that it goes inwards cant really explain it better than that my english is bad, anyways for the feeling in hand is not that comfortable when gaming due to the edges not being rounded. Also i want to mention that i have used an iPhone 13 Pro Max for around 8 months and it does not vibrate when the speakers are at max level. I am aware its not a fair comparison but just letting you know that its not true that all devices feel the vibration of the speakers if touched on the back. It has to do with how well put together the components are."

What the heck ??? What of it is about the build quality ? Fingerprint magnet on surface or the back is something to do with build quality ?? On max volume i expect all phones in what ever material they are made to have some vibration cause you know sound is vibration.

What about all that is build quality ? Do the phone bend easy and on touch is it soft or something ? Is the rear of the phone on touch like paper that bends in ? Any comparison to give on other plastic phones with more known brands to say that there plastic phones are in better quality and then how ?"

Can you tell me how good is camera, battery life and are there a lot of bloatware?
I am very wrong person to give you any feedback on this you ask. First of all i dont care about camera at all on a phone as that is good enough for me even when the phone cost 100 euro. It gets it's job done for my needs in life. Also i dont do any videos ever but with this phone i tried to make the 240fps video to see the slow motion but 240 fps is not slow enough to get the fun out of it.

Battery life is good but that is totally different person to person as it all depends on how much anyone use the phone and what they do with it as do they play lots of games or watch lots of videos or listen lots of music and so on and on."
Akame,12258,Xiaomi Poco F5 ,Nut,01 Jul 2023,"I am using the POCO F5 8/256 Eu version since 1 day:

Display 7.5/10 even if this is a 12bit screen with dolby vision and HDR the colors look washed out compared to the likes of Samsung, i had to change the quality to vivid and make it look more alive, regardless this is still a good and responsive display.

Performance 9/10 very fluid and runs cool all the time, games like Genshin run at 60fps medium without problems and 50fps at Very High graphics.

Camera 7/10 its a discrete camera, faces look pale but i believe you could tune the temperature to your likings, i was also expecting more details with the 64MP on, i believe my A52 does a little better job in the camera department.

Audio 7.5/10 could be louder and bass is discrete.

Battery 8/10 lasts long enough and the charging is fast i did a cycle 30-90% in 20ish minutes.

Built quality 6.5/10 its plastic and the back is a fingerprint magnet, also you can feel the speakers vibrating from the back of the phone if the volume is turned up to the maximum, nothing serious tho.

System and UI 7/10 this is just a temporary score , i am not used to MIUI yet but there are some features that were taken from Apple and Samsung so it will not be too hard to get used to.

I will update this in the next week for anyone that is interested."

But well for me it's too late as i already bough it for 410 euro and it was at it's first week like first 5 days in my country shops and also only 2 days for that price for the 8/256GB version so i am still happy for that price and think it was fair price for the phone"

Don't think so. You would have to run different production lines. Buy components from different suppliers in lower quantities so no discount for huge orders.

Reason why smartphones more expensive in Europe and USA: people here have money. Economic power House. People here have money to spend for things they don't really need. You pay extra and the Asian guy pays less.

Volkswagen does the same: offering it's E-cars cheaper in china. And when a German VW dealership imports such car from China VW threaten with a lawsuit. Germans pay extra so that VW can sell cheaper in china (to get bigger market share)."

I got it for 410 euro in Estonia on it's first week the 8/256GB version and it was at that price for only 2 days and then went back to 439 while now is 429 cheapest.

12GB version was like 479 and on that 2 days when i bought mine it was 439. To be honest i kind of regret on not going for the 12GB version but then again i dont think the 8GB is bad option. It's just it's not sold a lot as mostly all sell the 12GB version

In one page i look for the phone i have like 20 different shops for 12GB version while for 8GB there are just few only

Well to be totally honest i dont think in next 5 plus years there will be any need for more then 8GB ram anyways on anything for the phone. Maybe only the most heavy games only but most that is mainstream the like of Asphalt and so on games these dont need much.

And if games move to cloud based then you only need good screen in internet connection while the 8GB be enough and the cpu/gpu on 7+ Gen 2 is already over powered"

I never will understand what is this build quality people talking about all the time that it's bad or something or good or in the middle. Abuse tests dont show that it's a bad quality on anything. Look other plastic phones in the market and there abuse tests that bend in half and break easy

Performance: 8/10 - The Qualcomm Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 chipset with octa-core CPU and Adreno 725 GPU should deliver good performance for daily tasks and moderate gaming.

Camera: 8/10 - The triple-camera setup with a 64 MP main camera, ultrawide lens, and macro camera offers versatility for photography. However, without specific camera assessments, it's challenging to provide a definitive rating.

Display: 9/10 - The 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a high refresh rate of 120Hz, Dolby Vision, and HDR10+ support ensures smooth and vibrant visuals.

Software: 8/10 - The device runs on Android 13 with the MIUI 14 interface. It provides a feature-rich and customizable user experience, although personal preferences may vary.

Design: 7/10 - The device features a sleek design with a glass front, plastic back, and plastic frame. The IP53 rating provides some resistance to dust and splashes. However, the weight of 181g may feel slightly heavy for some users.

Battery: 9/10 - The 5000mAh battery capacity combined with 67W wired charging ensures long usage and fast charging capabilities.

Overall, the Poco F5 offers a good balance of specifications and features for its price range. It provides solid performance, versatile camera capabilities, a high-refresh-rate AMOLED display, and a large battery. However, personal preferences may vary, and it's always recommended to consider individual needs and priorities when choosing a smartphone."

Your X3 Pro works fine and a lot of other people who have the same phone works also fine.
The point is that there was motherboard issue with x3 Pro model and it was mostly in India market. That dont mean that all had the issue as the hundreds of thousands phones that was released had this issue. It was probably on minority of the sold devices but it got still reported and people complain about it as why now all the brand phones comments we see people ask motherboard issues for all the phones. Never mind that the issue was not on F series and already from X4 onwards there no issue of motherboards.

In mass production there will be defected phones as that would make sense. That is something no brand can guarantee that they wont have any issues on all of there phones released. All phones wont go trough the tests as like with what ever product is made. there be test done to like 100 phones out of the line of like 10k-100k

What do you disagree on my comment where i tried to explain that motherboard issue is yellow media troll misinformation ?"

There is no need to confirm anything. It's not like your brain would accept it anyways. It happened once for X3 Pro and now you expect the flaw to be in every new generation phones that Xiaomi is releasing ? Why dont you go around on every samsung phone opinion comments and ask motherboard issues or exploding batteries issues that samsung have had in the past ???

X3 Pro was 2 years ago and since then how many of Xiaomi/Poco phones have had motherboard issues ??? You and your kind are like broken record players that skip on the one line asking the same question over and over and over again like that is something that happens all the time with this brand while ignore other brands that have had same issues in the past"

Wow...Many Thanks for that reply. That really opened my eye on the two phones. I have always appreciated the speedy UI and excellent performance on a Poco phone ( F3 & F4) though updates can be a bit more better; a newly-released phone could have an ""optimised"" OS & UI on release but if the company doesn't take heed and listen to the feedback and pushing only 1 major update in a year then that for me it also a let down. In my experience in the past 24 months i found OnePlus to be slighty better though that might have changed this year. What do you think?"

If you can find A54 for cheaper than Poco F5 it is worth considering if you don't mind Exynos performance. I didn't buy it because it doesn't include charger, costs more than Poco F5 and no headphone jack. The camera on A54 is slightly better than A73 and A52s, both which have SD 778G, almost the same perf, if not better than the Exynos on A54."

Honestly guys, This or Galaxy A54?
I would think F5 is way better over A54
Have 3.5mm jack for headphones. Have way better performance chip that is basically flagship. A54 is basically like A52s with it's performance chip power.

A54 probably only have better camera but i am not sure as i dont understand much about cameras and it's a last thing i care when i look phones to buy.

Also A54 have slow 25W charging speed and no charger in the box.
Performance wise from Antutu v9 A54 have 506678 while F5 have 931174

Also A54 have under display fingerprint reader while F5 have it on side for power button.
Also A54 is 6.4 inch screen but is like only 3mm shorter then F5 with 6.67inch screen as F5 practically dont have any bezel.
And if you care for software updates then A54 have it longer but you cant install custom android on it so when it's support end it ends forever. While with F5 you can install custom android on it and go probably to android 20 or more"

Definitely the F5, in my opinion. The Redmi only has 2 things going for it: the camera and the 120W fast charging.

The F5 is vastly superior overall, because it:
‚Ä¢ has a chipset with flagship-like performance, which is very important in the long run (about 2-3 times faster than the one in the Redmi, gaming performance plus read/write speeds included)
‚Ä¢ comes with Android 13, and will get Android 15 (the Redmi comes with Android 12 and will only get Android 14)
‚Ä¢ is light weight, slim, excellent screen-to-body ratio and has a more attractive design (subiective opinion)
‚Ä¢ has a battery which lasts longer (according to GSMArena‚Äôs tests)
‚Ä¢ has a main camera which still offers very good performance, even though the Redmi is better at it

1. Camera - worse even in pitch black scenarios. The camera flash is almost useless it's not adding up any colors it looks dull. The flash is weak (Redmi Note 10S has a much useful flash, much better quality at dark scenes). Poco tricked us to think coz the phone looks like to have dual-flash but in reality it's only one. (same with poco x3 gt) In comparison, Mi 9 SE has a true dual LED flash. The camera is a joke esp at night.

2. Speaker(s) - It's LOUD but muddy, sounds like cracking an old radio at some point.. Even having Dolby Atmos it's pretty much useless. Probably cheap quality speakers

3. Screen - the FLOW AMOLED is the also a big disappointment as it's not vibrant, the color looks pale. I am compared the Amoled display, to Redmi Note 10S and Mi 9 SE the quality of Poco F5 is very far off from good in any way...

4. Keyboard - it's not as responsive to input there is a significant delay of keys as you type

Reviewers did not tell you these. (I am unfollowing them now, esp those only up for hype and dishonest) I am telling you to make purchase decision or just skip this phone and look for something else. If all I've mentioned concerns you, Save your money elsewhere."

Poco F5 for sure.

Almost double the points in Antutu, and has dolby vision, brighter screen.

Realme 11 pro + is rumoured to be ‚Ç¨519 (443,44 GBP), with 12/512 GB of memory.

You can get the Poco f5 12/256 gb version for 400‚Ç¨( 341,77 GBP) as of right now.

Realme only wins in Cameras,faster charging and maybe UI, but other than that go for Poco F5 if you would like performance."

My almost 3 years old and cheaper POCO X3 NFC 6/128 has better speakers, they're louder, sound richer and has more bass than the speaker on my POCO F5 12/256. The speakers on F5 are sounds flat, without DoblyAtmos it's shitte üòï. Even on the cameras section. I did side by side test and comparison and I am disappointed.

The OmniVision main shooter in F5 captures brighter photos in lowlight than the SONY IMX on the X3, but it produces noisy and soft images. Photos captured from X3 main shooter still produces sharper photos and retain more details even on PRO Mode.

The 8mp UW on the POCO F5 is capped at only 1080p@30fps while the UW on the X3 can shoot upto 1080p@60fps and 4k30fps. No more GoPro like videos which is my favourite on X3 which I always use for cycling and scenery, tho the UW on POCO F5 has a nightmode which captures bright images but is very soft and out of focus. Videos taken on UW of X3 has more detail and has better dynamic range than the one on F5.

SELFIE SHOOTER on F5 is the worst.. It is unusable on lowlight scenarios üòµ. Photos by the F5 selfie shooter are soft, noisy and losses a lot of detail in lowlight. My X3 don't have the best cam but it punches way above its price. I can't tell the same for the $400 POCO F5, but hey it's still SD 7+ Gen 2. If you don't put much attention on the cameras and only wan't a beast phone for gaming and values performance over cameras then F5 if for you, but if you like taking pics/vids and into mobile photography stuff, avoid this phone. Maybe just get the Thu Redmi Note 12 pro/12 pro+."

Poco F5 obviously. It has much, much better chipset (not an overstatement), has a headphone jack, much better battery life, cheaper and newer. S21 plus has better camera system that's all. Those who recommended S21 plus only care about looks and are technologically illiterate, fall for unimportant things like ""software update"". Hardware over software anyday for those who are wise.

Only thing going for S21 plus is camera, but if camera is truly your main concern, then much better options are available at that price. Be wise and avoid any product that has Samsung made chipset. Your phone will last longer and you'll save energy. Always buy TSMC made chip. Samsung fans will be offended by this comment, but don't let them be an obstacle in improving your life."

That's exactly the reason SD cards aren't used anymore. They're slow, insecure,... more
For local data storage, external SD cards are fine and their speed is enough for usage. The culprit is the the ""Scoped storage"" introduced in Android 11 and above which slowed down the performance of Storage Access by 20-30 times. Internal UFS storage is also affected equally but is apparently not visible because it is already way faster on hardware level and 20-30 times slow access is not felt by the user. But if you try the push it to the limits, you will feel that in some cases it is even slower than the external cards. E.g. I used to have 15000+ short video files in a folder in sd card. In a video player I was able to play back to back in shuffle mode without any lag. With the scooped storage it would take 10+ second to jump to the next video. When I put all the videos in the Internal UFS 2.1 storage, it would still talke 2+ seconds to jump to the next video. So the meaning is clear. Storage access has been slowed down to an extent to kill sd cards."

PostW3697,12258,Xiaomi Poco F5 ,3SL,30 May 2023,"Nice and well-equipped smartphone, purchased in the Mi Store.
But if you (like me) come from a predecessor (Poco X3), the innovations are simply too few. I was looking forward to the Amoled display, but colours were just not displayed nicely and look much better on my old device. If you really want to set and use everything (120 Hz, Wqhd) then you won't get through the day despite the large battery. And that's not the point for me, that I have to turn everything off just so that my battery lasts. The camera takes the same quality photos as the X3. All in all, it's too expensive a change that wouldn't have been worth it in my eyes, so I returned the device."

My first one, even though it was made from aluminum, bended. It just bended by being on my pocket. Of course in time, the screen cracked, and lastly one software update arrived and it became sluggish and almost unusable. To the drawer.

The last one that I acquired is lasting longer than I expected, but I had great expectations about its camera. It ticked all the boxes in paper. But, sadly, in the real life it's just a bad camera. I'd give it 4/10.

What bothers me about the Poco F5 is precisely the camera. It is so 2019. Worse is the fact that it never made ""flagship"" level camera, so it is not that the phone is equipped with once upon a time the best hardware around.

If you don't care about it, then it's absolutely for you."

Deliond,12258,Xiaomi Poco F5 ,8Gw,22 May 2023,"Here people are killing themselves because they are missing the slot for the SD card lmao
We are facing a mid-range the majority of people acquire devices from this branch for the simple fact that in this range it offers decent performance with the 3.5mm jack and the aforementioned slot for the expandable memory

¬øWhat's going on?

Despite facing details that 'supposedly' can ruin an IP68 protection that is incorrect there are phones that perfectly do not present any details.
Clearly the SD cards are slower than the storage SOLDERED to the motherboard of the device that is inevitable, but let's keep in mind that having more storage at the cost of it is not relevant the performance a priori if you are looking for a balance.
This happens with desktop computers to have 1tb HDD and 512gb in SSD so as not to wear out with so much reading and writing the main unit in fact is sought is to longevity the useful life of the device, this also happens on mobile phones or maybe they use virtual memory taking into count the speed unlike the RAM? lol
Only an ornament functionality to damage our storage gratuitously.

Why without God willing will your mobile be damaged, will your 256gb be saved in the cloud? how much will you have paid for it? that's where reliable SD memory comes into play.
Unless you open the phone and remove the embedded memory chip and put it in another phone, you'll get your data back, all good, but who does that? is it possible if anything?

Many users telling me we have our phone as a vault of both applications, images and high quality audio... and others files.
Not those images that you download from Google or an mp3 at 320kbs we are talking about images in heif or raw quality (8k or 4k) and studio-quality audio such as FLAC 1000kbps and WAV, a quality that Spotify certainly does not reach in the middle of this year 2023.

I don't see why they eliminate them if high-end mobiles like Sony continue to include them in their premium devices.

Are the brands not failing the user and his needs? Was it great that this phone included the 3.5 mm Jack but without enough storage? it's worth it?

In conclusion....
Apparently we have some frustrated users who want the mid-range to be high-end when it is not, mid-range always mid-range, perhaps they could not acquire that premium high-end that they wanted so much in its maximum configuration, so what they are looking for is to economize by adjusting the market to your high-end needs
So they are necessarily looking to insert their 'needs' as if they were the ones that a mid-range should have, error.

Dismissing it as obsolete technologies or having external drives because to top it off a certain user sarcastically recommends the use of USB when most of this range offers usb 2.0 because already being somewhat slow the SD would be worse.

Maybe they should turn around and look for another comment section in a range that clearly does not carry such attachments (as in a high-end such as the Samsung 23 Ultra, Xiaomi 13 Ultra, Huawei P60 Pro, among others) with ufs 4.0 no SD slot an not 3.5mm Jack because apparently they are willing to pay for cloud services and $200 headphones that sound the same as a wired one.

Do not fill the comments section just imposing your ideas on others or sarcastic reactions this is not a social network. If they are going to waste time other than on GSMArena."

Anyone please tell about motherboard issue briefly
Who would know about motherboard issues when the phone being out for public for less then a month. Is there issues with motherboard on Redmi note 12 Turbo that is same phone ?
12 Turbo is Chinese version that was out before F5 global so how would it be possible to have already motherboard issues out about it ?

Also it look more like a issue where the trolls like to spread the issue like it's a biggest issue ever for defaming the brand with other things like ads that can be disabled.
I have not seen it as an mainstream model issue where there are loads of news about it like it happes a lot. That can happen on all brands and for few to happen dont really mean that millions will also have it. that then again common sense tese days is rare sight"

I think it's protective film only as tempered glass is thicker so you probably need to buy it on your own if you want more protection but these tempered glass dont cost that much to buy it on your own if you really need more protection. Probably best to buy better case then also.

There are case's that even hide rear camera with slide door"

Flash drive?
Are you a 40yo bitter millennial?

Welcome to the 21st century, where people use microSDXC expendable card for smartphones because the storage for upper-mid range phones (SD 7) is small for a lot if not most users.

Not many people like you use smartphones only for calls and social apps like Facebook. Many use phones for pics, vids, large (mostly gaming) apps, alongside music and other storage consuming purposes.

Poco F5 without SD card slot is basically useless.
It's an UPPER-mid (you get it? upper??) range smartphone that lacks one of the most important UPPER (you get it now??) features."

Regarding ‚Äúalways on display‚Äù (AOD):
Poco F5 is the exception (max 10 seconds). Poco F3, F4, F5 Pro have true ‚Äúalways on‚Äù displays.

This may have something to do with the F5 being a rebrand of the Redmi Note Turbo, instead of the usual Redmi K series (F5 Pro is Redmi K60, hence true always on display). The Redmi Note series have always had only 10 seconds max AOD.

And it‚Äôs not just a software limitation. Some AMOLED panels can‚Äôt slow down to 1 Hz or even 10 Hz, therefore AOD will use up a lot of battery even if only a few pixels are turned on."

Anonymous,12258,Xiaomi Poco F5 ,Lec,13 May 2023,"ONLY INDIAN VERSIONS OF POCO PHONES ARE SCAM!!!
GLOBAL VARIANTS ARE FINE!!!

Indian version of Xiaomi phones are made in India, with Indian parts which are much lower quality than the original Chinese parts. That's why Indian versions differ from the Chinese and Global ones.

India introduced tariffs on Chinese components and with this forced Xiaomi to manufacture their phones in India. Because of tariffs, Xiaomi can't cheaply import original components and is forced to use Indian ones which are MUCH, MUCH lower quality. That's why Indian versions don't last very long and break very often. Global versions are made in China and literally don't have any issues at all, and also last very long.

INDIAN PEOPLE; JUST BUY THE GLOBAL VERSION OF THE PHONE AND YOU WON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES GUARANTEED. BEFORE BUY CHECK IF PHONE HAS ""MADE IN INDIA"" STICKER; IF SO, DON'T BUY IT."

In addition, Poco does not honor their warranty if the phone died due to software update, if the phone has scratches or even a tiny dent.

Here in the Philippines, there were also a lot of dead motherboards in the Poco X3 models.

I still would love the SD card, but I can personally do without with a CHEAP 1tb model of a phone. That is literally the only way. I mean, go on Amazon and look up the price of M.2 1TB ssds. Not too expensive, right? Even if this doesn't compare with the price of making storage chips in phones, consumers like me would rather just have something like 256gb-512gb depending on value for internal storage in a phone ALONG with the option to add an SD card for media files like music and photos + video. The argument of loss of files due to a damaged phone can be mostly (depends if you make daily backups) solved if you make backups. I also however, can't argue that file management through USB on Android phones is SLOW and taking out the Micro SD and just backing up files straight from that to your computer is MUCH faster. However, I can personally wait that long if I am just copying a few files each time I make backups since I am not copying everything over at once every time. I cannot argue that SD file management is much faster though, and that is a fair argument that people can make.

However, this phone ONLY has 256gb as the MAX storage you can put IN this phone, period. This is why I am not interested in this phone at all and do not deem it 'worthy'."

Also, Poco F5 is probably more water/dust-resistant, even though it has no IP rating, all of my Xiaomi phones that I've had with no IP rating could easily withstand some water splashes.

You do realize that this fingerprint scanner is probably much much faster than the optical under-display one? Unless the position of it is a problem, I don't see why would anyone want the inferior optical under-display scanner. Does it look cool? Yes. Is it more practical? Definitely not. I remember my huge struggle getting used to actually pretty fast optical scanner after switching from Pocophone F1, because F1's scanner was on another level - even faster. I hope it's the same speed if not even faster on Poco F5.

As I have mentioned previously, 8 gen 1 heats up a lot, hence the huge throttling. 7+ gen 2 is more efficient, which is better for prolonged gaming sessions.

Depends on what is more important for you.

Xiaomi Poco F5 is smaller and lighter, has headphone jack, more color accurate display, possibly much much faster fingerprint unlock as it is not under-display

Realme GT Neo5 SE has bigger, higher resolution and peak brightness display, faster charging, bigger battery, more RAM/storage variants, and is cheaper"

True.

One more difference I just noticed which might also explain the price difference is the fact that 12 Turbo has OLED display, whilst Poco F5 has AMOLED. Generally, AMOLED is more expensive"

Absolutely correct: A lot of POCO X3 & POCO X3 Pro Phones have gone dead within 1-2 years of purchase with no remedy to customers from POCO except the extension of 6 month warranty period. But that was too late and a lot of customers were refused for unnecessary remarks by the service center.
My POCO X3 too has gone dead since last 18 days and gone out of warranty just 4 months back. I have never faced this type of problem with any of the phone till now even from XIAOMI.

Gen 7, Gen 8 & MTK 8k series are 4nm, is not that flagship to you?"
technoelectro,12258,Xiaomi Poco F5 ,nt@,09 May 2023,"The SoC of this phone is very very good, I would not even call it mid-ranger. It's better than 888+ in all aspects and goes neck and neck with 8 gen 1: 7+ gen 2 has faster CPU but slower GPU. But keeping in mind that 8 gen 1 is manufactured by Samsung and has throttling issues, you might even expect similar if not better prolonged gaming experience on 7+ gen 2. For casual usage it's more than enough. Finally fellas we have a properly sized non-gaming phone with almost no downsides, with fast SoC, high refresh rate display and a headphone jack. I hate punch-holes / notches but if it's a large screen I can definitely live with that. Remembering Pocophone F1, I bet side-mounted fingerprint sensor will be much faster in this phone than the under-display one in the Pro variant. They really did a great job in decision making of the hardware of Poco F5, finally my wishes have been granted, though possibly useless macro camera makes me vomit. Poco F5 is more pricey than China's variant I think because of taxes and the Global version has more network bands. China's version might have more bloatware which reduce price but I am not sure on this. So a bit higher price might be reasonably justifiable. If anything, under 400 EUR for this beast is still very cheap compared with what other brands have to offer"

Only Chinese phones giving so much ram, definitely to run the services they will get benifits ... more
I think it's just all the anti-China sentiment getting to your head. Even if they wanted to run their own services, they wouldn't need that much RAM. Back in the day (before they were bought by Oppo), I bought a OnePlus 5 on release with 8 GB of RAM. This was back when Samsung flagships were shipping with 4 GB of RAM. Did OnePlus do that just so they could run their own services? Doubt it. Is it the reason why I was able to use it for 6 years and counting? Maybe, maybe not. I think the reality is, this is just another selling point the companies use as a selling point: future proofing (?).

Another thing you have to keep in mind is for phones, the CPU and GPU both share the RAM. So if future mobile games decide to continue improving on textures, there will be demand for higher RAM capacity. In this way, you could argue that more RAM helps ""future proof"" your phone. That being said, native mobile gaming will always be quite limited due to the limited power of the chips. It's not like you can just make a super powerful chip either; cooling, power efficiency, and area are extremely constraining for mobile. There is talk about cloud gaming on the phone which could be the future, but currently it looks like a work in progress."

Processor could be better but you can't expect too much here and is completely fine if you're not a heavy gamer. Camera is not bad; the 200 MP mode acts as a bit of a crutch.

What's even crazier is even at this low price, the guy at the Xiaomi store offered a free screen repair if it ever breaks without me asking for anything.

Most if not all of your listed chips are mid end to absolutely budget chipsets, on average, they are low end chipsets.

There is an upper limit (which is lower than that of tsmc) to the efficiency that Samsung fab can made. Low end chipsets does not need too high an efficiency to work properly, as most of them doesn‚Äôt go anywhere beyond 2000 Geekbench 5 points (hardly a half if those listed goes beyond 1500) and 5w power draw, so a Samsung level efficiency works. Flagship chipsets though need to at least go beyond its predecessor in peak performance so with that kind of efficiency that Samsung offers the phone sets your hand on fire at beyond 10w power draw.

And btw 4 gen 2 isn‚Äôt even more efficient than 4 gen 1."

A phone needs to be cleared every year to every few years and removable memory allows me the ease of doing it quick and easy. Plus i always have backups of my files if i break my phone and have to switch to a different one. I can also use my old memory cards for new things - DVRs, tv boxes, as usb flash (an adapter is 2-5 euros depending on the usb generation), etc.
It also allows me to save some money (galaxy s22 128gb costs 480eur, while the 256gb one is 540eur, for 20eur i can get a samsung 256gb V30 card. F5 pro is only available in 256gb, of which probably 20gb is reserved for system and updates and the 6% conversion penalty).
In July I cleaned out my almost full 128gb (had 5gb left) card and 64gb (had 10gb here) F1 and am now thinking of buying a 512gb card, because my phone is almost full again (mostly video and some photo, stumbled a few times around box64droid).

This also means wider custom ROM support from the community, which could give it a lot life support for the next 3-4 years (unlike regular 2 years support from Xiaomi).
