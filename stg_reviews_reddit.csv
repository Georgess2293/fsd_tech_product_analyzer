0,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,jnshns,10954,1/16/2022 20:20,Less battery score than the S21 on 500mah more.
1,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,Suukala,10954,1/16/2022 22:32,"I have to agree - unless you need a flagship SoC Galaxy A52s 5G is a better purchase for half the price, while not sacrificing that much. Got my mum 'regular' A52 4G and it has battery for days and apart from low light camera, I don't see much performance difference compared to S10 in daily usage.

IDK living with S10 Exynos for almost 3 years made me realize how important battery life is."
2,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,filosoful,10954,1/16/2022 20:10,"**Pros**

* Excellent AMOLED HDR10 screen, 120Hz, superb color accuracy.
* Good-looking S21-like body, water-resistant, grippy.
* Flagship-grade Snapdragon 888 5G chip.
* Outstanding camera performance, day and night, photo and video.
* Likable no-nonsense OneUI 4 with powerful features.
* Loud enough stereo speakers.

**Cons**

* No charger in the box.
* No dynamic screen refresh rate.
* No 3.5mm jack, no microSD, no AF for selfies (pick one).
* Expensive at launch."

4,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,ClacKing,10954,1/16/2022 22:54,I have the S20 FE and got it when it was on sale during Black Friday and love it. Worth every penny spent. Not sure if I would upgrade to this model but if I had to go back for a new phone it would be along the lines of this model.
5,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,cgknight1,10954,1/16/2022 20:34,Already down to £444 in the UK with the right deals - remember the ticket price on a Samsung is for the mad and to make the real price look good.
6,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,GabeNewellsDick,10954,1/16/2022 20:32,Seems like a pretty good phone that's just launched at a weird time and price point. I've already seen quite a few ways to knock loads of money off here in the UK (Student/workplace discounts and £150 trade ins for even broken Android phones) so I can see the price dropping pretty quickly.

8,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,SamsungAppleOnePlus,10954,1/16/2022 20:28,"100% worth it if you find it on sale. MSRP is just a bit high, reminds me of the iPhone XR being priced too high at launch. 

And as it stands, I’d take this over the Pixel 6 due to software bugs on the Pixel 6."
9,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,Majestic_Crawdad,10954,1/17/2022 2:47,">The most notable omissions of this new Fan Edition are the 3.5mm jack (not available on the S20 FE) and the microSD slot (available on the S20 FE). 

Stop trying to sell me iPhones it's not gonna happen"
10,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,IAmAnAnonymousCoward,10954,1/17/2022 7:41,"Let's say I can get this phone for $400, is there any better phone at that price?"
11,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,locomiser,10954,1/17/2022 7:39,"Did anyone notice they ran the stress test benchmark at 14% battery? On all my samsung phones, my in game performance drops after 15% battery, so I'm not sure if that's a relevant test. 

God knows how they did the other tests too, since it scores lower than it should in those."
12,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,drbluetongue,10954,1/16/2022 21:22,"I have just gotten the Exynos S21 FE 8/256 for a work phone.

The phone runs really well, just always a little warm even not doing much, and the battery is passable if you don't do anything intense. The screen is awesome too.

But man, the reception is trash compared to my SD865 Xiaomi. I'm on the same carrier for both and the Exynos is always worse. Seems like holding it with my left hand is the worst position for it. My dad has the S21 Ultra Exynos and his is the same. And I have a lot of Bluetooth issues with my car stereo.

I'm not sure I'd recommend it."

14,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,le_wein,10954,1/17/2022 8:22,"The phone costs in Switzerland 749 CHF (~820 usd) for the 128 GB version. You can trade in your old phone and you MAY get a discount of a maximum 150 CHF. From my side, I find this phone a joke at the price they are asking."
15,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,muhamedAMI,10954,1/17/2022 2:10,Why would you buy this instead of a s21?
16,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,Vaeltaja82,10954,1/17/2022 3:18,I think it is available in many countries in Europe for about EUR500. It is a good price for this kind of device. Only thing you could blame Samsung for is to announce the high price to make it look like an even better deal when they actually sell it for EUR500.
17,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,TheGunde,10954,1/17/2022 7:50,">Outstanding camera performance, day and night, photo and video.

I dont believe that.

\*checks samples\*Yep, looks like Samsung. Over-exposure, agressive noise reduction and over-sharpening."
18,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,forcedfx,10954,1/16/2022 23:46,As soon as it was 100% confirmed that the S21 FE would not have an SD card slot I ordered two S20 FEs
19,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,junglebunglerumble,10954,1/17/2022 9:52,"I bought the S20 FE last year and ended up selling it after 3 months, was the least satisfied I've ever been with a phone. The screen had awful touch issues, battery life was poor, the phone stuttered a lot, it had no proximity sensor, the camera was worse than the pixel 4a despite being 2x the cost, and Samsung cram their stock apps with adverts

Maybe some of those have been fixed this year but I'm still seeing posts about how good the S20 fe was, which makes me wonder if I'm just out of touch with what people want from a £600 phone these days. The pixel 6 is the same price and has been a million times better for me"
20,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,,10954,1/17/2022 6:38,"Kind of a shitty deal. 6GB ram in 2022? Plastic back is acceptable but 6GB ram base model is not. 

My oneolus 8T has 8GB ram and it came with a turbo charger."
21,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,IndefinitelyLegal,10954,1/17/2022 5:18,"The pricing is really the deal-breaker for me because S22 is coming out soon. So if they could lower it, i'll prolly upgrade my phone to S21 FE."
22,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,lloydpbabu,10954,1/17/2022 8:47,6GB RAM for base variant? Oh come on Samsung.
23,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,Vertsix,10954,1/17/2022 0:44,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. 

DO NOT get the S21 FE. 

It has the 888, which is a housefire. The modem is incredibly inefficient too, even on LTE. It is not worth it. I had the S21, and I couldn't put up with it. Drastic thermal throttling and lots of heat. Sold it and got an iPhone 13 Pro and couldn't be happier."
24,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,,10954,1/17/2022 3:36,"Mainstream tech media reviews = No real life reviews , go for small tech channels if you want some"
25,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,lord_krysis,10954,1/17/2022 5:40,S21 FE or S21 ? The better buy at same price ?
26,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,,10954,1/17/2022 16:52,No microSD -> kill.
27,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,IAMSNORTFACED,10954,1/17/2022 5:53,Same price as S20fe in my area after discount
28,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,evolutionvi,10954,1/18/2022 1:44,"So I've written off the S21 due to pricing and local Samsung promotions.


BUT the S21FE promotions will end Jan 31.


So.. S21FE 888, 8gb+256gb or wait for S22+ for around $250USD more?"
29,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,Soundtallica,10954,1/18/2022 12:17,"Aside from the newer chipset and 1 more year of updates, this isn't even an upgrade over the S20 FE. Even the cameras look to be the exact same, and it removed the SD slot. Flop."
30,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,nickgoescrazy,10954,6/5/2022 4:36,"I love this phone,it made me get cloud storage and I'm used to it,I put all my large files there,some apps allow free space up to 1tb,I don't worry about size limits when moving files,like you can move up to 4gb on micro SD cards at one time"
31,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,shadowboomed,10954,1/16/2022 20:25,Seems fairly obvious since the screen is not equiped with variable refresh rate.
32,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,Eagle0913,10954,1/16/2022 21:13,"My battery on my S20 FE is already shot after 1 year. I am not even close to a power user either. My screen time is 1.5-2 hours a day. I dont recall my Note4 & S8 battery lithium battery falling off a cliff quite like this so early.

Also why kill the microSD slot? The whole point of going with a more ""budget"" phone is saving money, 128 GB isnt a ton of storage in 2022 with apps getting so big and the capability of taking 4k video on the phone"
33,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,lukeroge,10954,1/17/2022 0:32,"I ended up getting an S20 FE on sale a month ago for just a tiny bit more than the A52s, that was a much better price point for a FE."

36,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,cmVkZGl0,10954,1/17/2022 0:44,"There is absolutely nothing about this phone that constitutes it as a ""Fan Edition"". If you look at the pros and isolation, it could be any phone, there's absolutely nothing that sets it apart.

The cons listed invalidate all of the Fan Edition talking points.

>**Cons**
>
>* No charger in the box.

Most people like to get the charger. Not including this is not a crowd pleaser.

>* No dynamic screen refresh rate.

Not the worst thing in the world but maybe something is better than nothing, even old tech.

>* No 3.5mm jack, no microSD, no AF for selfies (pick one).

The first two were the justification for this line for a while. The third one is just straight up vengeful.

>* Expensive at launch.

Again, this line was meant to be a cutback version with a cheaper price reflected. Now it's not even cheap.

This phone is 100% a cash grab. I think they have killed the entire moniker of Fan Edition now by making a mockery of it. Failed, frugal, fucked, choose your most colorful adjective, because it definitely isn't for fans."

40,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,miicah,10954,1/17/2022 1:58,I won't be. Either getting a Pixel 6A or an S22 FE (if they fix the problems with the S21 FE).

45,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,Jimmeh_Jazz,10954,1/17/2022 17:00,Important to note that this is with some sort of discount from your employer. It's much more expensive without that
46,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,mitragy_king,10954,1/16/2022 22:20,"They should have foreseen the microchip shortages and rescheduled release days accordingly. This could have came out last year along side one if the foldables instead of releasing the two folding/flipping models at the same time. The z flip should have released, z fold should have been delayed with upgraded camera hardware. They're going to kill their company really quick in these hard times by using precious microchips for phones that they'll sell more of."
47,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,KBeightyseven,10954,1/22/2022 16:23,"I got mine direct from Samsung uk for £550 by trading any android phone, working or not

At that price it's an awesome deal, also not sure if I'm lucky or not but mine is a SD888 and not the exynos variant."
48,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,PopDownBlocker,10954,1/16/2022 22:14,"They artificially inflate the price so that it will eventually settle on the true price once people take advantage of ""discounts"" and convince themselves that they got a good deal.

It's a very scummy tactic, similar to how Samsung advertises ""sales"" on their website but really it's just a lower price AFTER you trade-in your current device. There is no sale on the actual price."
49,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,xxTheGoDxx,10954,1/17/2022 2:48,"> FE should ideally have been a high mid range device, but it seems like samsung makes a mid range instead and prices as near as flagship. 

Did they though? I disagree considering this has a flagship SOC, flagship rear facing cameras (with a better telephoto than the full S21) and a screen that is better than most other flagship phones with the only exception that it isn't LTPO (which is purely a power saving feature). On the pro side you get a slightly bigger screen and at least in Europe a better SOC than the normal S21.


IMO Samsung clearly just made another alternative S21 here and honestly other than the worse selfie camera I wouldn't call it more mid range than the S21 is at this point in time."
50,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,,10954,1/16/2022 21:47,"Just played with the S21 FE and the Pixel 6 at Best Buy. The difference in screen quality is immediately noticeable making the Pixel 6 look bad. To be fair, both of those displays beat out my S20 FE."
51,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,Darkknight1939,10954,1/16/2022 23:10,"This isn’t comparable at all to the iPhone XR’s price. The S21 FE came out almost exactly a year later than the base S21/S21+ and costs more in most markets.

The iPhone XR didn’t come out a year after the XS phones and cost more. The most controversy around the XR was people sneeding about the screen resolution, and promptly doing an about face when almost every Android phone dropped from 1440p to 1080p pentile displays.

The S21 FE is too late at this point, and is bizarrely priced. It’s the victim of too many SKU’s making it awkward to slot into a price bracket for Samsung marketing. The S22 phones releasing in a month may very well be effectively cheaper with the fire sales Samsung does on their mainline flagships."
52,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,Gsantos52012,10954,1/16/2022 21:53,"Just got a pixel 6 like a week ago and haven't had that much issues, specially with the January update that was just pushed yesterday. only issue I'm having is the fingerprint sensor is still a little slow. It got a bit faster with the new update, but it's not that bad"
53,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,ripstep1,10954,1/17/2022 17:44,Eh. Wireless headphones are pretty good for most consumers.

55,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,xxTheGoDxx,10954,1/17/2022 2:54,"> Why would you buy this instead of a s21?

Bigger screen, better telephoto and (in Europe) better SOC vs worse selfie camera and maybe slightly worse battery life in 120hz mode.

The both cost around the same here in Germany by now."
56,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,bfk1010,10954,1/17/2022 8:28,"At this price point, I would not recommend it at all.

In my country S21 256GB cost exactly the same as S21 FE 128GB.

There's no reason to but it at all.

And S21+ 128GB cost the same as S21 FE 256GB."
57,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review,noxx1234567,10954,1/17/2022 2:34,"Its cheaper in certain markets.

Lol. Havent seen a more ludicrous take in a long time.

Just to be clear, more ram equals more apps that can be put to sleep instead of closed, increasing the speed of the phone.

Its not just the amount of memory an App can use.

I'm not saying that sales/discounts are scummy or that trade-in discounts are scummy.

I'm saying that it's scummy to lie about a discount by:

- advertising a trade-in as a new discount off the MSRP, even though it's not a new sale or discount because the MSRP is the same. (In Samsung's case, they've always accepted trade-ins, but they advertise lower prices which most people will not receive unless they trade-in the most valuable device on Samaung's trade-in list, e.g. an Ultra or a Fold.)

- purposely raising the price of a product to then lower it back to the true MSRP and pretend that it's some kind of deal. Stores like Khol's do this all the time. Prices are always inflated and there is a permanent 20-30% sale on items."

They ask you to pay a huge amount of money but they offer you some kind of ""free"" gift, like earbuds or power banks or phone cases. However, a couple of weeks later, Amazon will have the same product but it will cost less (approximately the full price minus the ""gift"").

I'd rather pay a lower price altogether than a higher price that comes with a ""gift"".

It was a total disaster. The phone was sluggish, with apps freezing and crashing left and right. I couldn't even watch a simple video without it stuttering and lagging. And the battery? It drained faster than a leaky faucet. I don't know how Samsung managed to mess this one up, but it's safe to say that I won't be recommending this phone to anyone.

Or would it be better to wait for the FE or S24 to release to find an even better deal for S23? Is it common to find good deals for non-FE versions after the release of FE?

284,Samsung Galaxy S23 FE promo videos leak,abhi8192,12520,9/28/2023 15:49,Patent issues. IIRC for modem. They would need to use qualcomm modems and the cost of licensing them(plus exynos chips required) would be more than just outright using a qualcomm chip.
285,Samsung Galaxy S23 FE promo videos leak,apoiuztrewq,12520,9/29/2023 11:38,I stand corrected. However iirc the 8 gen 1 (without +) had some issues.

Pricing was getting way too close, and it's better (imo) to ship one good phone than two okay phones with seemingly random tradeoffs.

Hopefully, this means Samsung is serious about decluttering the lineup. Cutting the A line from 11 to about 5 models could work wonders for giving a clear pricing path and reducing self competition."

It made sense with the s20 Fe because the s20 proper had a QHD screen.

Ever since the S21 and s22 and that's 23 now have 1080p screens and have been nerfed, there's really no reason to have an Fe device.

It's basically just a phone with the plastic back which I guess is an advantage for some but the MSRP is probably going to be $100 less than the s23.

But of course by the time the Fe comes out the s23 will be regularly on sale for below that"

Honestly, I think the 2100>888 for the FE series. Doesn't hurt that the one in the FE is a modified 2100 with better thermals than the standard S21 lineup.

Only con is battery. I have to charge it twice a day sadly but I don't have the money to upgrade anytime soon so I am gonna use this phone until it's end of life lol."

I have a Samsung A23 5g. It's not a great phone. It boots slow, Samsung Internet freezes when you search, the camera is from the 2010s and it's generally mediocre. BUT! It's got the 3.5mm jack, it's got an SD Card slot and you can insert 2 sim cards along with that SD Card."

Plus S20FE uses some cheap selfie camera that is nowhere near comparable to anything of flagship level and even the ultrawide and telephoto lenses are different from those of the S20

I'll definitely jump on the S23FE if it'll have the same 1750 nit dynamic amoled and the same cameras, but that sounds nearly impossible to me with how greedy samsung is"

I definitely agree it is better if the option is there, but it isn't and hasn't been for a long time. I know the audio quality on wireless is not as good, but the comfort of not having wires is a positive that you can't ignore either. 

Like, I get it - I would want a headphone jack too. But I'm not gonna limit myself on other new features on newer phones like a better screen, performance, faster charging, etc just so I can have a single feature that the industry has chosen to move on with (whether I like that or not)."

Well tehnically newer because both have 4 major years of update and 5 of security. So the fe started with android 11 i think it will go yo 14. While the latest A should be on 13 so it will go to 17 way better support in the long run."

477,Samsung Galaxy S23 FE rumored to launch in H2 2023,NearbyMathematician9,12520,2/17/2023 16:31,"The usuals right? at every price point a manufacturer has to consider within the bill of materials batteries and receivers.

So sure you can get a great sounding 150 dollars TWS, but at the same price you can get DT770s. Sure you can get 20 bucks no name tws, but you could also get Chuus.

Also there is a hardware longevity issue (batteries degrade over time, tws are easier to lose). good audio gear can easily be passed to your children if you take care of it and I realy really don't like the move to ""let's turn precious metals and poisonous chemicals into ewaste"" \[shout out to samsung that at least makes their buds battery relatively repairable\].

I don't have an issue w/ TWS, I have an issue w/ forcing people into it.

On a more philosophical level I don't vibe with the idea of making phones less capable, I want them to become more and more useful and feature rich as to replace the need to buy more and more and consume.

It already replaced point and shoot cameras for most people, it already is the first access point to the web for a lot of people that don't think of themselves as ""phone geeks"", I want it to become better not just for dipshits like me that want ""muh minimalist one device for all, singularity huehuehue"", but also for the people that can legitimately only afford a 300 dollar phone"

I wish 8/256 version of Poco is available to me. Unfortunately, I can only get 6/128 version.

**UPDATE:** Bought Poco X5 Pro 5G. If I add in calculation I need to buy charger, USB-C to 3.5mm dongle, case, screen protector, A54 goes way above 450€ to somewhat around 520€ if not more. I would have had paid 489€ for the device if it had everything included, but it doesn't.

So far, Poco serves me great. I removed all bloatware apps and a lot of MIUI apps which I plan to replace with 3rd party. Unofortunately, I couldn't remove MIUI Security app, but MSA, MIUI Analytics, MIUI Daemon and other Mi apps (Video, Music, File Manager, App Vault, Browser etc.) are gone."

It takes one look at PC GPUs and CPUs and we can see that lower nm actually doesn't mean anything for the end consumer.

663,Is Samsung galaxy A54 worth to buy?,Roddaxter,12070,7/18/2023 1:45,"It is a good buy. Obviously it isn't better than the Galaxy A52s in every aspect (gaming power and GCam support 'cause A52s has the snapdragon 778g), but it is an improved phone overall.

The galaxy A54 has better screen, cameras, battery (standby, light and normal use), design, android update policy, body (glass is more interesting than plastic), and it has a 256GB version, if you want/need more space.

The lack of a snapdragon chip over an exynos is not that bad. The exynos 1380 is optimized and if you aren't gaming every day, it should be fine.

My main problem is the lack of a headphone jack. I love it, its simple, its analog, its practical. I still want it on a new phone."

689,Samsung Galaxy A54 is a hit.,Alarmed-Strawberry-7,12070,9/4/2023 8:00,"It has everything the average person needs, so no wonder it's ranking so high. As a pretty average phone user, I'm really liking my A54, screen is nice and vivid, battery lasts enough for me to not have to worry about my phone's battery percentage all the time, and I also think it feels nice in the hand. I got the official smart wallet case too and the little clock window is really cool. The Exynos chip is really bad for GPU tasks but that's fine. The A54 is about 80% of a flagship for basic tasks, so most of the time it feels like a premium device when you're just sending messages, reading an article or watching videos. This year has been really bad for mid-rangers all around honestly, Samsung wasn't my first option but after seeing everything else on offer it was definitely the best option for me at least. My main concern was battery life, and after locking the refresh rate to 60hz I charge it like every other night.

Also, kinda weird that there's a whole subreddit for a single make, model and year of phone."

Only Samsung doing good in here. BUT Samsung also did good in Europe/US, those versions have E-SIM support and I guess they used more A+ material in them. I did also noticed that they took an event to promote A54 in Asia market. It was actually very interesting we used to see S and Flip/Fold phones ads & marketing I never thought that they would have a night gala for A series."

Mostly because of some old devices I had were worth some surprising value to Best Buy which got me the A54 for about 8 US dollars. (Although they also did honor the Amazon price of $350 which helped)

It doesn't blow me away but it does everything I want in a phone. Has decent battery life, got an SD card slot, the camera is pretty nice (Not on par with the Pixels I've had but it's a good middle ground of where I'm fine with it), has a flat screen making good screen protectors easy to find, and has quite a long update cycle as well.

Only thing I can really complain about is the glass back, I never cared for a near all glass body or whatever that 'premium look' is. A case immediately gets slapped on my phone right as it's out of the box, but glass can still break which is why l love screen protectors.

First i was damn pleased with A54, and was thinking to buy it when my Mate 20 started dying. Then Honor 90 came to market with 600€ price tag for pre-order. That also included Honor Tab x8, Honor/Huawei Freelace Lite earpieces and super charge (things that don't come with standard pack).
Now A54 got smashed @ every single point except for stereo speakers (if anyone cares about that).

Why i compare this two phones when they aren't in same category, well Honor 90 12/512GB model are selling for 450-500€ while A54 is selling for 400-450 (380 was lowest and that was for one weekend).

There's so many options for unlocking the screen that I often forget that opening the case alone wakes the screen up. The silicone material also gets very grimy when you first get it, but about a month later my fingerprints aren't showing up on it anymore. The only real widgets you get in the case window screen are phone calls and music, it doesn't have any third party integrations like showing your uber trip status or distance left on google maps or anything like that.

And i do have to say, pairing with the watch5 pro has made the experience so much awesomer in a subtle way, just being able to do things like play music in my car without having to take out my phone, answering calls and texts, all the normal shit but i love it."

I directly compared the haptics of the S22U with my S21U and an iPhone. S22U felt not only weak but also cheap. S21U was significantly better and close to the iPhone.

It arrived at the office a couple days ago and I should have it in my hands tomorrow, but in reading reviews, I fear I may have made a mistake in ""downgrading"" from Ultra to the Plus - possibly something to do with FOMO... I don't have the S-Pen now, but would I use it? (I do have a stylis for my iPad and I don't use it much). I don't often take zoomed photos, but maybe I'll start. And stepping down from 12GB of RAM to 8GB might somehow have an effect on my experience with the device.

Worst case, I send it back and change it for the Ultra, but if anybody has any insights, I'm all ears."

> The Fold can also win a productivity battle with the Ultra - easily, thanks to a way larger display and, yes, S Pen support too, even if the stylus is not quite as convenient to store as the Ultra's.

Woke up with about 25% battery left while the display was awake for 9 hours. Decide to push it to 15% to see how much more the battery could be pushed. Needless to say...this is an insane battery and a far cry from the abysmal battery life i got on my s22 Ultra.

EDIT: Should add that i am on Light Performance Profile.

Edit 2: Used the phone next day for work. Unplugged at around 7 am and came home around  4 PM. From 100%-69% was on mobile data with 95% of it being 4g and rest being 5G. Was on wifi while I was home. Decided to test how it would fare the next day so I did not charge it over night. Slept with 46%, woke up 5 and a half hours later with 45%. Used it till it was 43% then placed it on the wireless charger in my car while I made myself to work which brought it back upto 46%. Used it from then on to tether to my chromebook while being connected to 5G nonstop for the next 3-4 hours to connect to my PC, basically hammering the mobile radio. Overall should give a bit more 'realistic' usage over what a day looks like on it and how good the battery really is.

A smart watch and staying in range of it helps to not miss notifications. And if you're buying a top of the line flagship, you could probably squeeze in a Samsung smart watch to match it.

For those unaware, Samsung devices are infamous for their shutter lag and horrible performance taking pictures of moving objects. Even with the latest good lock update including settings to reduce shutter lag further, it still struggles hard against moving subjects.

https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-galaxy-s23-ultra-finally-better-at-taking-photos-of-moving-objects

Personally, it doesn't matter much to me. If the subject moves a lot, Ill just record a video in 4k and grab blur-free stills from that. That trick worked great on my S21 Ultra, and it still works on my S23 Ultra.

There's a bug on the official Samsung store right now where you can stack the 10% off with accessories and other discounts.

If you search s23 ultra on Google & click the first promoted link for Samsung store, that'll get you the first 150 off. Then add a galaxy smart tag at checkout for 10% off the whole order. In total you should be able to get it for approx 750 if you trade in your S10. Deal ends today though.

I wasn't willing to drop 1200 on a phone either but 850 is about the same as a pixel 7 pro, and you can get that price even trading in a non working phone for the 150 bonus."

But still, while there are improvements in specific places, looking at them as a whole, the S23 ultra's only advantages come from battery life.  Which isn't unimportant, but at the same time my S21 ultra was never problematic when it came to battery life.  

Plus the trade in on the S21 u from Fi is poor at $100--though of course, the $600 promotion offsets that.  I just hate that Fi requires a specific device to remain the active device for X months, and imposes other things like you can't change your plan or even go between esim or physical sim on that device.

I use to buy a new phone every year and this is the first time I waited 3 and upgraded from the S20+ to the S23 ultra.
814,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,CirkuitBreaker,12024,2/14/2023 0:29,Apparently the battery life is vastly improved over the s22 ultra due to the change in the SOC.

819,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,robothistorian,12024,2/12/2023 4:00,"Good point.

Regarding the Fold though...I had seriously considered buying the Fold 5 and using that as my upgrade path from the S22U. But I decided against it and since a fortuitous set of circumstances came about, I got the S23U instead.

My decision against the Fold was mainly because of (1) my having a iPad Mini 6, which I constantly use as a Notepad and casual reading device. I would have used the Fold for this too. But that would.mean the Fold doing double duty as a phone and as a table which would inevitably hit battery life. Best to keep the two functions dedicated to 2 devices, and (2) I am still not confident about the screen tech on the Fold."

The bulk I see more as a point of preference. I know some people like the size of the Note 23, and that's fine for them. If the S23 and S23+ were closer in spec I think that would be best. I don't mind if they want to keep making Note phones, but I do mind the that the traditional Galaxy S style phones are gimped to upsell people on the Note. 

Also, I'd list a curved screen as a con. I know some people like it, but it's a point of structural weakness. And cheaper tempered glass displays can have issues with glue accumulation on certain areas of the screen. Also, it will cause glare and distort the image."

Lol what? Maybe if you're talking about width or length? Its not thick or ""bulky"" at all. They've avoided making it thicker and putting new battery in for years.

> no charger in the box

Not really a con. Saves wasted materials. I haven't needed a new charger for 5+ years. And nowadays I don't use almost any manufacturer included chargers, I use 100W-250W+ third party chargers that can charge all my devices at once at every compatible speed imaginable."

I travel a lot so a good camera is kind of worth it, but also you get to a point where the difference between ""50"" MP and ""200"" MP is going to be bugger all in reality.

My biggest concern probably is the decrease in RAM... but at the end of the day, I'm not sure what I use my phone for is that RAM intensive - Device Care shows 6.7GB of 12 used. In fact, I probably grossly under-use my phones myriad of features as it is.

Else a s23+ goes 1350 - 120 cashback and 180 trade in, its 1050 euro.  
A samsung a53 is 350 euro, considering even the s10 has enough cpu power for what I do, social, work call, messages, browsing, I would basically pay 650 more for a better camera and design.

On paper it's objectively worse but some people enjoy the software and camera experience a lot better than they do on Samsung phones. Also isn't as aggressively priced
929,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,need-help-guys,12024,2/12/2023 6:11,"I know it's kind of in vogue to hate Samsung lately due to their string of screwups, but up until 10nm, Samsung processes were every bit as competitive as TSMC. The reason this happened, as I understand it, is because Samsung actually wanted to 'leapfrog' TSMC, by skipping a node and beating them to GAAFET transistor types, which as we can see probably didn't go as well as they had hoped, even if they did launch GAAFET first.

And just as you say, the real difference between the flagship Exynos and Snapdragon was rather miniscule for the most part, as they were using the same stock ARM cores. 

From what I'm reading, although 3nm GAAFET has a new transistor type, it doesn't confer a full node advantage or anything. So it's more akin to TSMC's current 4nm, with their second generation aiming to catch up to TSMC."

Used it till I was at 43% and then put it on the wireless charger on my car as i made myself to work which brought it up to 46%. Constant 5G while tethering to my chromebook which streamed my Home PC nonstop for the next 3 hours or so, hammering the radio.

Having a smaller phone, but still be powerful with the stuff that I am used to (battery life, 1440p screen) is simply not possible with Samsung latest models. Don't know what to do.

1028,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,mgcarley,12024,2/13/2023 7:40,"Noted.

So I got the phone in my hot little hands this arvo. 

So far... it seems ok. I've transferred all my data over, but haven't really given it much of a bashing yet as far as doing stuff on the phone.

I did take a couple of pictures and... it would seem the camera on the S23+ beats the S20U... not exactly obviously, but zooming in on the photo on my laptop, the S23+ was superior both in the standard 3:4 12MP mode as well as the top mode (3:4 108MP and 50MP respectively). 

I took photos at the exact same time right next to each other of the pillows on my bed and examined them on my laptop... the shading cast by the pillow and the lighting on the S23 seemed to give vastly superior detail and clarity, and better colour.

So at least one of my fears has so far been alleviated.

Tomorrow - its first workday - will be the real test."

1033,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,MuzikVillain,12024,2/12/2023 12:25,"I'm not the person you asked but as a past Pixel 6 and current Pixel 7 owner who just pre-ordered the S23U I'll share my experience. 

Cons

- Battery life

I'm averaging between 3 to 5 hours SoT. Mind you most of it is on 5G in a bad reception area (my job has no Wi-Fi and a bad carrier reception area). Still even on my days off connected to Wi-Fi the phone still will only do between 5 to 7 hours SoT. My use is moderate usage of Reddit, Discord, and Music playback with less than 30 mins of video and gaming. 

- Reception

Again this may be influenced by spending most of my day in a spotty reception area but I've noticed my phone can't even load Reddit or Discord messages plenty of times unless I reset the network then suddenly reception is fixed and I go from <2 Mbps to 25+ Mbps. 

- Fingerprint Sensor

Vastly improved from the Pixel 6 but is still a tad inconsistent for my liking considering I've settled for not installing a screen protector and increasing sensitivity to give it the best chance. 

Pros

- Camera

Outstanding! The pictures are is so fucking good that if not for the camera I may have returned it within the return period. The pictures are that good. Shutter speed is instant and the magic eraser tool while not perfect is so convenient and good at what it does. I never realized how many moments I missed in the past before I had such a good camera in my pocket. 


The video is good, not great but does a fine enough job that it doesn't feel out of place compared to photos. The Selfie camera is inconsistent, sometimes it takes great pictures sometimes they are average. 

- Pixel Experience

I am a big fan of near-stock Android. It gives you what you need, a few extras, and outside of that no bloatware or nagging features. 


- Value

In terms of features, it is a pretty well-rounded phone that competes in some aspects with flagships but struggles in some noticeable areas (at least for me). That being said at its current price it offers great value and as long as you aren't a power user I think most owners may not be as affected by the listed cons and will enjoy its positives. 


I really want to love this phone, but I think the Tensor G2 still struggles to be power efficient for my usage so I'm hoping the early reviews of the S23U being a battery champ are true. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have."

It’s because Samsung seems to skip frames. You can see it [in this video at 3:11](https://youtu.be/cApuvGrrR_Q) on the right phone (S22U) on OneUI 5.

I have my screen on FHD+ too and 5G is disabled in the service menu as well as the cellular options so not very impressive. Dunno about SOT but I'd say it was 5 odd hours.. Maybe 5 1/2. I use my battery widget to track general battery life which is showing at a full charge lasting 24 hrs approx which is basically where my 4XL was when it was new, however there's more apps installed nowand eufy too which uses a bit.. So maybe it's a bit better.. It's just not much of an upgrade haha"

I'll give you consistent parameters, but GSMArena's battery tests are just as bad because they use unrealistic usage patterns for their tests. 

Their video playback test is looping a standard definition video in Airplane mode. 

Their web browsing test is strictly over Wi-Fi."

It's outside of my area of knowledge so I can't speak to the specifics as much, but that they're not immune to issues is more my point."
1080,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,RaccTheClap,12024,2/12/2023 3:02,"iPhones don't shut the cellular modem down when on WiFi, they just put it into a deep sleep from what I can tell as long as your carrier has wifi calling enabled. It'll definitely prefer a cellular connection if your signal strength is strong from my experience but who knows what actual characteristics are used for it to decide what to stick to for calls/texts, the most power hungry part of a celluar modem is a data connection anyway so it doesn't matter much if the cellular modem is on waiting for a text/call.

As for the other guys 5G comment, they have 2 5G options, 5G auto and 5G on. 5G on is basically what you think, it'll always use 5G for a cellular connection if one is available no matter the task it's doing. 5G auto will use 5G when you're doing something on the phone, like loading twitter for example but if you're streaming music and put your phone in your pocket, it'll just use LTE bands to maintain battery life while streaming the music as long as whatever LTE bands you're using aren't congested. It's actually pretty good in my experience at making sure you've always got a decent connection, and it will sacrifice battery life if your LTE anchor bands are too congested to be used alone.

In my experience, using T-Mobile and Verizon, T-Mobile on 5G auto will drop to just 5G and not 5GUC (N41) since LTE is quite performant in my area and can handle pretty much everything, even 4K streaming without buffering however on Verizon, it seems to hold onto 5GUW (N77) much more aggressively since Verizon's LTE is horrible in my area for the most part. I don't know how much control the carriers themselves get over that behavior in their carrier bundles but I imagine Apple overrides the behavior as they see fit."

1083,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,TheRetenor,12024,2/14/2023 18:45,"Entire OS'es can be run from SD cards these days. The switch and Steam Deck take SD cards no problem for games.

Yes, they will be slower in terms of writing, but the only use case that might really make problems is 8k recording or 4k with high refresh rate. And for those edge cases (for example in burst mode photography) the internal storage is usually used by default, even if the storage is set to external.

And then after finishing nothing keeps one from moving the files manually. Also, nobody stops google and the likes from implementing such functionality.

&#x200B;

They just refuse to do it. Why, you might ask? Because there is no incentive. People have sucked up the removal over the years and all the manufacturers much rather sell their cloud storage anyways. You can charge monthly for that. An SD card is a one-time fee."

Probably because that's not what you said. 

You talked about Snapdragon and Exynos chips having major differences, but the last two (E2100, 888 and E2200 and SD8G1) didn't have battery efficiency differences to nearly the same degree compared to previous years.

1128,Owning a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra - THE TIMELINE,D00M98,12024,5/30/2023 18:35,"My story:

* Similar to OP, I spent over a month on comparison shopping: between S23 Ultra, Google Pixel 7 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max.  Particularly comparing camera reviews.
* Next decision is whether to buy the phone myself (out of pocket), versus using company subsidized.  Out of pocket: phone is unlocked; trade-in ($300 off); sales discount.  Company subsidized: carrier locked for 2 years; no trade in; price is retail - $700 off.  So delta is $400.  Although I'm not made of money, I just don't want to deal with carrier lock, ever.  Decided to pay out of pocket.
* Saw S23U lime with free 256GB to 512GB upgrade on Samsung.com.  Went to the Samsung Experience store to see if they have lime on demo.  No, all online colors are not available at store, even for demo.  Have to take a leap of faith, that lime looks reasonable in person.
* Right after ordering S23U online, check reviews on cases.  Bought Spigen Ultra Hybrid and Rugged Armor.
* Received the phone by FedEx in 5 days.  Lime color is cool and looks great.   Immediately enjoyed the improved camera capabilities.   Self affirmation on decision well made ;)
* Chose Ultra Hybrid Zero One over Rugged Armor, because it just looks cool. https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23/comments/139dzjo/spigen_ultra_hybrid_zero_one_and_rugged_armor_on/
* After 2 weeks, read about people having scratches to the screen.  Although I hate screen protector, I got concerned.  Checked reviews.  Didn't want to go with tempered glass due to the curved screen.  Bought Milomdoi TPU screen protector.  Babied the phone until screen protector arrived.  So far so good on the TPU screen protector.
* After 4 weeks, able to put the camera thru real life tests on all the various modes.  Realized limitations with the camera.  Start to have buyers remorse :(

Well, this is where I'm at today.  Still think S23 Ultra is a great phone.  But the camera output has limitation, on how I shoot.  I have to work around this limitation.

Here is my next decision.  For company subsidized phone, I an get Google Pixel 7 for $1, or Google Pixel 7 Pro for $120.  I probably will go with Pixel 7, since it is basically free.  Then I can play and compare the S23U vs Pixel 7 cameras."

1180,Samsung Galaxy A53 5G vs Samsung Galaxy S22 5G,Zealousideal-Cold110,11253,10/4/2022 1:27,You can wait for the a54 might be a good buy
1181,Samsung Galaxy A53 5G vs Samsung Galaxy S22 5G,OpenStars,11253,10/4/2022 5:14,"Go hold an A53 in a store and after one minute you'll see the difference. I thought people were exaggerating, but when I pressed a button and nothing happened on the screen, figured I did it wrong, but then FOUR SECONDS later it finally responded. Something is seriously wrong with those phones...bad software tuning maybe, I dunno, but it does not feel good.

So next I considered a Pixel 6, but they aren't good -> neither a match for what I wanted, nor the hardware being reliable (the Pros are better but the non-Pros seem like they are plagued with many factory defects - like people reported not getting texts for DAYS, something wrong with the modems). There are just no good mid-range phones out right now...

So I went up instead, and my S22 that I got instead feels very snappy. I don't like how hot it is all the time, and wondering what I can do about that like maybe it's a case issue or if I need to throttle it or some such - it's a bit uncomfortable actually but not painful, exactly (well, sometimes, when I play games on it; I wonder if I can keep 120 Hz for scrolling but lower it to 60 Hz specifically to grind out daily game tasks, when I don't really need to look closely at it anyway).

Also, OnePlus phones *sound* better, stat-wise, for gaming, but I refuse to be fooled by them again. The reason I needed a phone all of a sudden this year so soon after getting my OP7T is bc they released an update that caused my phone to get so hot that it literally melted some internal component and now it gives me like tiny electrical shocks or flash heat or something that left red marks on my skin. Clearing the cache completely solved the original intense heat that was far hotter (I'm not joking, I literally thought it might explode), but DAAAAMN! Tbf some may say that I should have factory wiped it to be on the safe side, and maybe that's true... but the update said that it wasn't necessary, so my point that one should not trust that company remains valid, especially after they got so profit hungry they made the co-founder quit in frustration upon delivering a historically & world famously bad update. I'd much sooner trust Samsung than OnePlus.

The A53 lag issue would have driven me absolutely *nuts*, and I would have hated every minute of it. I'm much happier with my S22, even though I wanted a cheaper option and it's not perfection, but it's good. Among 2022 phones, even including the S21 FE, it seems like the best option, imho. My battery life isn't stupendously awesome, but it gets me through the day (okay maybe with a top-up sometimes, but it is what it is, and I don't want to lose 120 Hz -> I'd rather just have an extra charger with me!:-P).

The only options to really ensure days-long battery life is to either buy an older phone model, or go ""down"" past the A53 to even cheaper phones, like Moto's or some such. Although if that's the comparison you are interested in, note than disabling many of the S22 features such as 120 Hz screen and 5G can also get you battery life of multiple days, on a phone where you can turn those options back on for times where you have ready access to a charger. It's nice to have ""options"":-) Also, the adaptive switcher somewhat does this automatically for you, like if you are watching a video with 30 FPS, it will switch down from 120 Hz so as to save battery (unlike the S21 FE where you'd have to manually switch over).

What can I say - the A53 is ""cheap"" (but not, like I had strong hopes for, in the good way: they must have delivered special units to the reviewers bc their issues are extremely obvious to anyone who looks at them), while the S22 is expensive and very much overkill, while also being underwhelming in many ways e.g. battery life. Welcome to the 2022 phone market though, where it beats everything but an iPhone, and I'm never going back to iOS again so...S22 is *it*, for me."

I couldn't imagine something like that being hardware-driven, with such a processor as it had. Also, physical stores in particular have their anti-theft and other software on there that can mess really bad with some phones. Thanks for saying that, in case anyone were to read this and be mislead b/c my info was oudated.

BTW the more I use my S22, the more I really regret having spent all this money on it. I eventually did give up my 120 Hz, not b/c of battery but b/c it lowers the heat issues. Truthfully the S22 Ultra is supposedly better in that regard since it has an actual physical fan, though it's also so giant that most people don't want to actually hold it in their hands, and the S22+ has a metal case that supposedly makes it easier to dissipate heat (although I don't know if that would still work so well through the addition of a plastic case to provide drop protection?). Also most screen protectors interfere with the thumbprint unlock so like whenever I really focus and hold it normally and do it then it works just fine but then more than half the time when I just want to get in and check something real quick, it locks me out and I couldn't get in if my life depended upon it (though there's still a pattern lock so not THAT big a deal).

1199,Samsung Galaxy A53 5G vs Samsung Galaxy S22 5G,OpenStars,11253,2/10/2023 22:51,"The size is something you control: there's like a 5% difference in cost iirc for a S22+ vs. a S22. I wanted something smaller, so I got what I thought would work for me, but you should choose what works best *for you*.:-)

It sounds like I would have been much happier with a A53. I literally went to the store with the full intention of buying one right there on the spot, and although I had heard about the slowness issue, I figured it would have to be pretty bad to make me look elsewhere. Unfortunately, at that time that I went, it **really was that bad**:-(.

I barely use my camera even so it would be perfect for me to skimp (heavily!) on that, to get a phone that I enjoy in every other way, something more akin to the old Google Nexus line, before the Pixels came out (and went the exact opposite direction: instead of a superb high-spec phone paired with a decent-ish camera, Pixels are world-class cameras coupled to a barely acceptable very low-end spec phone, that I guess you can upgrade still further but there's no way at all to downgrade that camera for cheaper price) - i.e., I didn't want a ""flagship"" phone, but rather a ""flagship killer"" like the olden days that has everything I want and nothing that I do not (as the OnePlus series used to be up to about the 7T or perhaps 8 and then they went full-flagship after that). Unfortunately, those don't seem to exist these days, for the most part...

Except for the A53, which at that time wasn't acceptable quality to me. Plastic backing is totally fine, but a 4s delay between every button press and an eventual response was NOT anywhere close. I'm very glad to hear that they improved (as I suspected they might but I needed a phone FAST b/c of what happened to my previous device). So too late for me, but not for others it seems:-).

And as I mentioned I'm outright regretting my S22 - for one it's a behemoth, hot device, that actively hurts my hands when I try to use it (is it my fault for playing games? maybe, except reviewers said they did it and it was fine!? and like it's a thing that people do sometimes, so not beyond the normal scope of activities that someone might try to do with their phone; plus sometimes it'll happen even while web browsing! THAT...doesn't sound okay, so like I wonder what all it's trying to do in the background that is causing it to heat up, maybe an update or cycling the modem or some such, as I've read if your connection to the tower is poor then it'll keep trying like that, even if your wifi is poor, although notably on the same carrier on my previous device it was just fine!? I even went to the store to get an updated card, and it seems like it's actively worse now than when I first bought it? So a poorly designed modem it would seem, if it's allowed to make the device painful to use), and for another it was so expensive, so definitely NOT worth the price.

Again, I probably would have been much happier with an A53 myself, if only they had been halfway functional at the time I needed it...:-(.

I should say tho that it's decent in all other respects - no missed calls, no skipped texts, etc. The heat issues aside, it's a decent phone, just, as you say, not worth its enormously high price."

Samsung are too adamant to let go of their pointless modifications to Android and outdated design language that doesn't go well with the current design language of Android at large.

Lots of features, terribly put together."

The 6.1 is the perfect size for me, my pockets, my truck  console, etc. The bigger phones I find are also too heavy for me. If I am watching a streaming show in landscape mode it gets very heavy very quick. I tried and ordered one and I could I ly handle it for a week and then had to trade it back in for a normal S10 and have not gone back since.

The fp scanner is amazing coming from the P7, it's failed maybe a total 4 times in the past week whereas the P7 would fail like 30% of the time, and there is no annoying bright light.

The phone is also smaller, thinner and lighter which I prefer, and not having that big camera bar in the back is nice.

Screen quality is also better with improved contrast and colors.

I don't think I'll ever need to buy a new phone again until this thing stops working, it's pretty much perfect for me.

You can get started with a simple setup with a 512GB-1TB drive for about $60-120, less if you have a router that supports file share/wireguard. That way, you can keep a good amount of data locally and have relatively easy access to your own personal stash when you need it, with the only downside being the occasional swaps.

1401,Samsung Galaxy S23 review,Iohet,12082,2/8/2023 22:13,The cognitive dissonance in the sub regarding the hatred for proprietary standards unless it's the proprietary standard *you* like is hilarious
1402,Samsung Galaxy S23 review,,12082,2/9/2023 7:26,"I will play devil's advocate here; DV is far less relevant on screens that can do 1000+ nits fullview. DV's benefits over base HDR10 materializes when heavy tonemapping had to be done (aka on OLED TVs capping out at 600 nits playing 1000+nits content).

Most HDR content online are barely mastered over 1000 nits, let alone the 4000 nits standard DV uses. Most streaming shows in ""HDR"" are garbage sub-400 nits HDR master that's basically just SDR thrown into an HDR container anyway, even the high profile ones. In this sense, I see Samsung's stance against Dolby as a lesser evil. I'd rather our content be on an open source format than on Dolby's proprietary tech. It's not like HDR10+ will be limiting in the near future even. HDR adoption is already slow; Dolby getting to court the entire market would make it even worse. Only a few American productions get access to the Dolby Pulsar and virtually no international production has ever had access to it. 

The current problem is not Samsung's refusal to surrender the format war, but that they seemingly refuse to even fight it. It's almost like they're content with just having it on the checklist and calling it a day. They need to get more streamers other than Prime to adopt it. Supporting filmmakers to master in it would also help. As it stands, virually no Korean production has an HDR master (unless it's Netflix backed), let alone an HDR10+ master.

The other real benefit of DV is in gaming, where you can ensure it always maxes out your display's brightness. But that is irrelevant on phones."

An expensive product with features you will never truly need up the arse. And usually it has the most advanced panel on the market on release. Why cut such peculiar corner?

1428,Samsung Galaxy S23 review,Troutman2112,12082,2/10/2023 3:11,I guess everyone is different. Samsung does a good job with the one hand use minimization. I just can't get the hang of it well for some reason. Which is weird because I am so dang big. But oh well it is what it is. I guess I will stick with medium phones. The good news is that it seems like the S23 base is going to be good. So I am looking forward to it!

1437,Samsung Galaxy S23 review,didiboy,12082,2/9/2023 0:16,"Dolby seems to have a better relationship with movie studios I think. Streaming services went mostly with Dolby too. It also helps that Dolby has a lossy version of Atmos that could be used in streaming, maybe there is a ‘package deal’ for studios? 

While Samsung being a holdout is huge, I don’t think it’s THAT impactful for the growth of HDR10+. Yes, Samsung is the biggest TV brand, but most consumers don’t know the differences between HDR formats. And consumers that do know probably went for brands like Sony or LG who had OLED offerings way before Samsung did."

If you're used to bright white (blue basically) being your color temperature then a calibrated display will appear yellowish in comparison. 

Dolby vision has nothing to do with color temperature, that can be changed. Go ahead and play an HDR video on YouTube and see what the color temp is in your settings and then go play some dv content on Netflix and do the same. I bet they're on a different setting."

To me, the smaller size of the base S23 is far more valuable than any of the extra features the ultra has to offer, and the newer processor and much improved battery life makes for quite a large upgrade in usability when compared to last year's S22.

you will obviously most likely not be able to use the phone one handed much, but if you don't care then get the ultra (better for content watching, etc)

i can use like less than half the screen with 1 hand

1522,Is it worth buying samsung galaxy s23 base or better get S23 Ultra?,simmic3,12082,4/12/2023 11:47,"UPDATE:

Ended up getting S23 Ultra :D

I remembered that I always wanted to try phone with a pen, so I went for it and I love it. I thought that if I get base S23 it will be same like old phone but with better specs, but a phone with pen is totally different experience.

The size is big, but I'm getting used to it. It feels slippery without a case, so looking for a case now.

Cameras are fantastic!

For the battery need to test for longer.

Customization is sick! One Ui has tons of new features. My wife has an iPhone, for a second I thought I should get an iPhone too, but looking at the customization perspective and a freedom (compared to iOS) android is FTW. iPhone is great too, but not for my taste

Samsung phone displays are nice but overall i prefer pixel 7 pro display. No matter what the application is, its nicely caliberated. S23 lineup doesnt keep the skin tones right..i mean more yellow..and shadows are missing... Could have been a better black level... Less black levels/contrast make it look washed out. I found pixel 7 pro overall consistent and pleasing for eye. Im not saying s23 line up is shit but still im saying sometuning interms of black level and highlight handling...coming too washed often in reels and shorts especially. Please dont think s23 has everything, its a myth. Some like stock software experience, some look at overall phone who deliver everything... All you can do is settle for one which deliver your primary requirement. S23 has everything in paper. But let that not be a reason to go for it either. Find your higher priority and go for that phone. Obviously it going have its own downsides in comparison but you wont regret it. I own s23 ultra, but display, im not satisfied to be honest. I saw pixel 7 pro, really pleasing to the eye. But it has their own issues. I mean magenta tint while you watch it some angle, shitty tenser processor causing overheat...  So i had to let it go. But software is smooth and out of this world. Which s23 can only dream of.. but when you speak of s23, customization obviously is there and call recording 🤌 which no one has today."

And i do have to say, pairing with the watch5 pro has made the experience so much awesomer in a subtle way, just being able to do things like play music in my car without having to take out my phone, answering calls and texts, all the normal shit but i love it."

I directly compared the haptics of the S22U with my S21U and an iPhone. S22U felt not only weak but also cheap. S21U was significantly better and close to the iPhone.

I hope Samsung fixed that in the S23U."

It arrived at the office a couple days ago and I should have it in my hands tomorrow, but in reading reviews, I fear I may have made a mistake in ""downgrading"" from Ultra to the Plus - possibly something to do with FOMO... I don't have the S-Pen now, but would I use it? (I do have a stylis for my iPad and I don't use it much). I don't often take zoomed photos, but maybe I'll start.

EDIT: Should add that i am on Light Performance Profile.

Edit 2: Used the phone next day for work. Unplugged at around 7 am and came home around  4 PM. From 100%-69% was on mobile data with 95% of it being 4g and rest being 5G. Was on wifi while I was home. Decided to test how it would fare the next day so I did not charge it over night. Slept with 46%, woke up 5 and a half hours later with 45%. Used it till it was 43% then placed it on the wireless charger in my car while I made myself to work which brought it back upto 46%. Used it from then on to tether to my chromebook while being connected to 5G nonstop for the next 3-4 hours to connect to my PC, basically hammering the mobile radio. Overall should give a bit more 'realistic' usage over what a day looks like on it and how good the battery really is.

My job is a little more mixed, but when I'm in the field on job sites, I try to just leave my personal phone in the truck or next to the power tool battery chargers. Helps that I have a company phone so I'm still reachable for work shit carrying something I don't have to pay for if it breaks... But yeah. Try to leave the personal phone off your person. A smart watch and staying in range of it helps to not miss notifications. And if you're buying a top of the line flagship, you could probably squeeze in a Samsung smart watch to match it.

The curved screens really are more delicate. Sucks you can't get a decent tempered glass for them either, including Whitestone dome."

1626,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,that_90s_guy,12082,2/12/2023 4:45,"Nice bait lol. 

For those unaware, Samsung devices are infamous for their shutter lag and horrible performance taking pictures of moving objects. Even with the latest good lock update including settings to reduce shutter lag further, it still struggles hard against moving subjects.

https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-galaxy-s23-ultra-finally-better-at-taking-photos-of-moving-objects

Personally, it doesn't matter much to me. If the subject moves a lot, Ill just record a video in 4k and grab blur-free stills from that. That trick worked great on my S21 Ultra, and it still works on my S23 Ultra.

And in the worst case scenario, I can always use my wife's iPhone 13 Pro Max for action shots."

1635,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,ItsSuplexCity,12082,2/12/2023 19:29,"Same boat. The S22U felt like a downgrade from the S21U in terms of the battery life, speaker quality, and haptics. Due to the added width, it was also harder to grip. Samsung seems to have fixed the battery and speaker quality but not the haptics.

I am going to give the S23U and shot and do a side by side with the S21U to make the call whether to keep it or not."

There's a bug on the official Samsung store right now where you can stack the 10% off with accessories and other discounts.

If you search s23 ultra on Google & click the first promoted link for Samsung store, that'll get you the first 150 off. Then add a galaxy smart tag at checkout for 10% off the whole order. In total you should be able to get it for approx 750 if you trade in your S10. Deal ends today though.

I wasn't willing to drop 1200 on a phone either but 850 is about the same as a pixel 7 pro, and you can get that price even trading in a non working phone for the 150 bonus."

But still, while there are improvements in specific places, looking at them as a whole, the S23 ultra's only advantages come from battery life.  Which isn't unimportant, but at the same time my S21 ultra was never problematic when it came to battery life.  

Plus the trade in on the S21 u from Fi is poor at $100--though of course, the $600 promotion offsets that.  I just hate that Fi requires a specific device to remain the active device for X months, and imposes other things like you can't change your plan or even go between esim or physical sim on that device. I got bitten by that one already."

Regarding the Fold though...I had seriously considered buying the Fold 5 and using that as my upgrade path from the S22U. But I decided against it and since a fortuitous set of circumstances came about, I got the S23U instead.

My decision against the Fold was mainly because of (1) my having a iPad Mini 6, which I constantly use as a Notepad and casual reading device. I would have used the Fold for this too. But that would.mean the Fold doing double duty as a phone and as a table which would inevitably hit battery life. Best to keep the two functions dedicated to 2 devices, and (2) I am still not confident about the screen tech on the Fold."

The bulk I see more as a point of preference. I know some people like the size of the Note 23, and that's fine for them. If the S23 and S23+ were closer in spec I think that would be best. I don't mind if they want to keep making Note phones, but I do mind the that the traditional Galaxy S style phones are gimped to upsell people on the Note. 

Also, I'd list a curved screen as a con. I know some people like it, but it's a point of structural weakness. And cheaper tempered glass displays can have issues with glue accumulation on certain areas of the screen. Also, it will cause glare and distort the image."

Not really a con. Saves wasted materials. I haven't needed a new charger for 5+ years. And nowadays I don't use almost any manufacturer included chargers, I use 100W-250W+ third party chargers that can charge all my devices at once at every compatible speed imaginable."

I travel a lot so a good camera is kind of worth it, but also you get to a point where the difference between ""50"" MP and ""200"" MP is going to be bugger all in reality.

My biggest concern probably is the decrease in RAM... but at the end of the day, I'm not sure what I use my phone for is that RAM intensive - Device Care shows 6.7GB of 12 used. In fact, I probably grossly under-use my phones myriad of features as it is.

Anyway, it's literally on its way to me right now, so I'll hang on to it for a few days and if I don't like it, I'll send it back or give it to an employee and get the Ultra for myself."

Else a s23+ goes 1350 - 120 cashback and 180 trade in, its 1050 euro.  
A samsung a53 is 350 euro, considering even the s10 has enough cpu power for what I do, social, work call, messages, browsing, I would basically pay 650 more for a better camera and design.

The reason this happened, as I understand it, is because Samsung actually wanted to 'leapfrog' TSMC, by skipping a node and beating them to GAAFET transistor types, which as we can see probably didn't go as well as they had hoped, even if they did launch GAAFET first.

And just as you say, the real difference between the flagship Exynos and Snapdragon was rather miniscule for the most part, as they were using the same stock ARM cores. 

From what I'm reading, although 3nm GAAFET has a new transistor type, it doesn't confer a full node advantage or anything. So it's more akin to TSMC's current 4nm, with their second generation aiming to catch up to TSMC."

Having a smaller phone, but still be powerful with the stuff that I am used to (battery life, 1440p screen) is simply not possible with Samsung latest models. Don't know what to do.

So I got the phone in my hot little hands this arvo. 

So far... it seems ok. I've transferred all my data over, but haven't really given it much of a bashing yet as far as doing stuff on the phone.

I did take a couple of pictures and... it would seem the camera on the S23+ beats the S20U... not exactly obviously, but zooming in on the photo on my laptop, the S23+ was superior both in the standard 3:4 12MP mode as well as the top mode (3:4 108MP and 50MP respectively). 

I took photos at the exact same time right next to each other of the pillows on my bed and examined them on my laptop... the shading cast by the pillow and the lighting on the S23 seemed to give vastly superior detail and clarity, and better colour.

So at least one of my fears has so far been alleviated.

1866,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,MuzikVillain,12082,2/12/2023 12:25,"I'm not the person you asked but as a past Pixel 6 and current Pixel 7 owner who just pre-ordered the S23U I'll share my experience. 

Cons

- Battery life

I'm averaging between 3 to 5 hours SoT. Mind you most of it is on 5G in a bad reception area (my job has no Wi-Fi and a bad carrier reception area). Still even on my days off connected to Wi-Fi the phone still will only do between 5 to 7 hours SoT. My use is moderate usage of Reddit, Discord, and Music playback with less than 30 mins of video and gaming. 

- Reception

Again this may be influenced by spending most of my day in a spotty reception area but I've noticed my phone can't even load Reddit or Discord messages plenty of times unless I reset the network then suddenly reception is fixed and I go from <2 Mbps to 25+ Mbps. 

- Fingerprint Sensor

Vastly improved from the Pixel 6 but is still a tad inconsistent for my liking considering I've settled for not installing a screen protector and increasing sensitivity to give it the best chance. 

Pros

- Camera

Outstanding! The pictures are is so fucking good that if not for the camera I may have returned it within the return period. The pictures are that good. Shutter speed is instant and the magic eraser tool while not perfect is so convenient and good at what it does. I never realized how many moments I missed in the past before I had such a good camera in my pocket. 


The video is good, not great but does a fine enough job that it doesn't feel out of place compared to photos. The Selfie camera is inconsistent, sometimes it takes great pictures sometimes they are average. 

- Pixel Experience

I am a big fan of near-stock Android. It gives you what you need, a few extras, and outside of that no bloatware or nagging features. 


- Value

In terms of features, it is a pretty well-rounded phone that competes in some aspects with flagships but struggles in some noticeable areas (at least for me). That being said at its current price it offers great value and as long as you aren't a power user I think most owners may not be as affected by the listed cons and will enjoy its positives. 


I really want to love this phone, but I think the Tensor G2 still struggles to be power efficient for my usage so I'm hoping the early reviews of the S23U being a battery champ are true. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have."

It’s because Samsung seems to skip frames. You can see it [in this video at 3:11](https://youtu.be/cApuvGrrR_Q) on the right phone (S22U) on OneUI 5.

1913,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review - GSMArena.com,RaccTheClap,12082,2/12/2023 3:02,"iPhones don't shut the cellular modem down when on WiFi, they just put it into a deep sleep from what I can tell as long as your carrier has wifi calling enabled. It'll definitely prefer a cellular connection if your signal strength is strong from my experience but who knows what actual characteristics are used for it to decide what to stick to for calls/texts, the most power hungry part of a celluar modem is a data connection anyway so it doesn't matter much if the cellular modem is on waiting for a text/call.

As for the other guys 5G comment, they have 2 5G options, 5G auto and 5G on. 5G on is basically what you think, it'll always use 5G for a cellular connection if one is available no matter the task it's doing. 5G auto will use 5G when you're doing something on the phone, like loading twitter for example but if you're streaming music and put your phone in your pocket, it'll just use LTE bands to maintain battery life while streaming the music as long as whatever LTE bands you're using aren't congested. It's actually pretty good in my experience at making sure you've always got a decent connection, and it will sacrifice battery life if your LTE anchor bands are too congested to be used alone.

In my experience, using T-Mobile and Verizon, T-Mobile on 5G auto will drop to just 5G and not 5GUC (N41) since LTE is quite performant in my area and can handle pretty much everything, even 4K streaming without buffering however on Verizon, it seems to hold onto 5GUW (N77) much more aggressively since Verizon's LTE is horrible in my area for the most part. I don't know how much control the carriers themselves get over that behavior in their carrier bundles but I imagine Apple overrides the behavior as they see fit."

Yes, they will be slower in terms of writing, but the only use case that might really make problems is 8k recording or 4k with high refresh rate. And for those edge cases (for example in burst mode photography) the internal storage is usually used by default, even if the storage is set to external.

And then after finishing nothing keeps one from moving the files manually. Also, nobody stops google and the likes from implementing such functionality.

I don't know what to do and I am afraid if I will use it fir heavy use like YouTube streaming, online gaming, online movie watching then how long will it stay? 

I have a galaxy f12 which is lowest priced phone but it's battery doesn't drain so quickly

Those devices also usually have better bartery life because their processors aren't as power hungry.

It's also always a bit of a gamble buying items like these from a random person. 

People here also almost always buy their phones outright and to get a new S21 you'd have to shell out at least 100€ more than this costs if you buy it online which is a very big if because many people here still exclusively buy their phones in an actual physical store which won't have 2 year old models in stock"

Keep in mind both this phone and the A34 use older process nodes, Samsung 5nm and TSMC 6nm ( X nm is not technical terms, but marketing ones) so they are nowhere near the latest and greatest.

Also it's samsung and it's OneUI, just got the phone yesterday and i'm glad that i didn't go for any of the chinese phones that my carrier had. They had xiaomi, oppo and realme in the same price range that the A34 is, but samsung beat the chinese phones by: 
- being ip67 rated
- having a 120hz screen 
- having better, more stable OS
- having a slightly better CPU
- having an AMOLED display.

The super amoled is such a big game changer man, i've always used huawei and then xiaomi phones and now went for the samsung - the difference in viewing angles, contrast, vibrancy of colors, AND THE BLACKS, bro. My xiaomi feels like a knockoff wish.com phone compared to the samsung screen.
The operating system is very snappy, lag free and intuitive to use. The only drawbacks i found so far is that the battery could be a little bit bigger (something like 6000-6500mAh) because a 120hz screen is a drain after all but the battery life itself is not a problem, and they don't include a charger, you need to buy one yourself for around $20-$30"

I'm currently using a Redmi note 11 with an AMOLED display, I've seen OLED ones too and personally I don't see a difference. Samsung also has lcd displays at the lower range. Not fair to generalize all cheaper Chinese brands with a bit higher priced Samsung. Even the Chinese brands have a decent selection with good specs including the display.

Some people might also not want the inconvenience of having to replace an already aging battery.

EDIT: If it was about money specifically, people would be buying used midrangers. Why don't they do it? Bad repairability (basically none even), poor support, battery issues (again repairability). Also software updates. A 400$ midranger will do most people A LOT better than a used (and possibly half broken) used flagship for the same price.

Maybe you just haven't noticed or you keep your phone at room temperature all the time so you experience less degradation. Lithium ion batteries are generally at 80% their original capacity after 300-500 cycles or two years. If you use your phone down to 50% every day for two years, that's about 300-400 cycles. It also depends on how the previous owner took care of the phone, some people use their phone until it dies which hurts the the battery. 

Phones with bad batteries are also likely to be over represented in the used market as that would be a legitimate reason to buy a new phone."

And no, not every phone has that. There's been plenty of examples where phones outright shit the bed in battery testing, thinking back to Galaxy Exynos early days.

Now I'm not sure where you're getting the new feature circlejerking from, the people here are usually the first who jump at phones and pointing out the lack of features a predecessor phone had.

One also has to watch out for features that are Android features and not manufacturer features, there's lots of things Samsung did five to six years ago that are just now coming to Android as default features that people who don't use Samsung phones outright haven't seen before."

>single review to judge battery health. 

There are mainly 3 things that affect battery life in Android Phones majorly, for the usecase of MOST people.   

1)Battery size: 5000 MaH puts is well above average for a phone, according to ALL sources.    


2) SoC: many reviews show the SoC in this phone is more efficient than most SoCs around while offering decent performance     

3) OS and optimization: Samsung has historically decent track record with it, jury is still out on this phone, but OneUI is generally optimised     

Now tell me, is the conclusion just from one review alone or you are being a condense cabbage?"

2033,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,againagainst_,12074,4/11/2023 22:44,"Well, I've heard about Pixel 6 bugs. I've been using Pixel 7 (base model) for about 5 months. Well, somewhere I can see bugs, but they are usually directed to opening the cam from the lock screen. In the main system, I would say that there are the same amount of bugs as on iPhone (I had been using iPhone Xr for 2.5 years and 13 mini for 6 months and then switched to the Pixel). It's a great phone, so yep, wait for the 7a. They tend to be as great as the main model (imho, but plastic on the back is better than glass), and if they put 90 hz display it will be a great phone"
2034,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,Conqi,12074,4/11/2023 13:27,"It's 6.1 inches. That's close enough to the 6 inches they asked for at least. Not really that small though, that's right.

Didn't know the 10 IV isn't available in the US. Your selection really sucks when it comes to Android phones sadly."
2035,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,sleepypandacub,12074,4/11/2023 19:31,The display was stunning for such a small phone and price point. Hope they reintroduce a compact A series phone.
2036,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,WarriorOfShadows,12074,9/26/2023 14:41,"The chinese OS's were fine and dandy (i had xiaomi, huawei and pocophone) until they started shoving ads up my ass on literally every other click i done in the system. Fuck that shit. Also older MIUI and EMUI were clean, fast, snappy and had a nice flow. My experience with current ones (latest xiaomi phone i've used was made in 2021) is that they are bugged (SOMETHING JUST HAS TO CRASH OR LAG IN A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT, ALWAYS), animations are done poorly and the overall flow and navigation of the OS is sucky sucky."

2038,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,Zerasad,12074,4/11/2023 10:38,"That's the thing. I don't want to spend 800 bucks on a phone (what the S23 costs here). The ASUS zenfone 9 is literally the perfect phone for me, but it costs 900 dollars. I can't justify that peice when I never game on my phone.

It's so weird that all the premium phones like the iPhone 14, Samsung S23 and the Pixels are a reasonable size and none of the midrangers ever try to go for a model at the same size."

2041,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,i5-2520M,12074,4/13/2023 7:45,"Insane take. The A52S is still very OK, and you can get it used here for like the equivalent of 175$."
2042,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,Revolee993,12074,4/11/2023 10:46,"Sad to say but small phones only cater to a niche audience and the yearly sales volume shows. Even Apple abandon the mini variant when the total sales volume of it is [less than 5%](https://www.notebookcheck.net/iPhone-13-Mini-sales-continue-to-disappoint-as-rumors-claim-the-iPhone-14-Mini-may-be-axed.593194.0.html) of total shipments.

It sucks to be you but the mass consumer market has spoken with their wallet so most corpos are gonna cater to this target audience. It's just like the trend of dropping 3.5mm jack and expandable storage. That ship sailed a long time ago. Either you embrace it or be left out.

P.S: Perhaps maybe wait for the 7a? That might be a better successor to the 6a I almost forgot."
2043,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,CaptainTipper,12074,4/11/2023 15:03,As said above you can import the global version of the Zenfone for a lot less. Go to official ROG store on places like AliExpress and you can get it for much less. Though will take a while to arrive is the downside.
2044,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,WarriorOfShadows,12074,9/26/2023 15:31,"Yeah, i dunno mane, i'll probably just be a samsung fanboy from now on until i come upon something even better in my budget. You can have all the amazings specs, cpu's and shit, but if the OS is poorly made it will run worse than a phone with 2x worse specs. But it is like that with almost everything, if something is well calibrated, well made and works like a freshly oiled machine it will always outperform something that on paper should be tenfold better."
2045,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,nickthaskater,12074,4/13/2023 7:55,"Mmm ""very ok"" for $175. Sounds great."
2046,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,Zerasad,12074,4/11/2023 11:03,"6 inchers aren't ""small"" though. I understand why we no longer get sub 5.5 inch phones, but the regular iPhone 13 had the majority of sales at 51% and it's 6.1 inches. It literally sold more than all of their other phones combined and the iPhone 13 Pro which is also 6.1 inches sold almoat as much as the pro max. The 6.1 and under phones made up 3/4ths of all sales, yet they only make up like 3% of newly released phones. There has to be an executive somewhere that looks at these numbers and thinks, ""Hmm maybe we should try just one midrange phone with a 6 inch screen.""

Maybe the Pixel 7a will be my phone, but at this point, I'm not really holding my breath."
2047,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,Zerasad,12074,4/11/2023 15:18,"The cheapest I could find on Aliexpress is still 730 USD, when I wouldn't want to spend any more than like 500 or 550."
2048,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,i5-2520M,12074,4/13/2023 8:11,Did you even look at the spec sheet? What is that phone missing?
2049,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,Revolee993,12074,4/11/2023 13:28,"The definition of 'compact' in the mobile space has evolved significantly over the years. 5.5 inches which is considered a phablet in 2013 is now considered a compact phone or even below average. 

It's a shift in mobile computing as consumers liked the idea of a large display device that is both portable and immersive which is why the first Galaxy Note is so revolutionary for its time. Even Apple executives had to eat their own words when they had no choice but to embrace the large display trend as well.

You can't directly compare what your needs are as a consumer vs what the executives think as a business. A business is almost always going to be a profit-driven perspective first whether you like it or not which is to cater to the masses. 

The iP13/13P/14/14P are also about the [same size](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/size/Apple-iPhone-13,Samsung-Galaxy-S23/phones/11634,11999) as the base S22/S23 as well so I don't understand what the fuss is all about. In fact, the S22/S23 might even be a tad smaller and lighter. If you were to compare a compact phone from e.g 2019, the S10e [didn't grow that much in form factor at all](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/size/Samsung-Galaxy-S23,Samsung-Galaxy-S10e/phones/11999,11114) when compared to the recent S23. [Only the bezels shrunk and added a larger battery capacity for longer endurance](https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=12082&idPhone2=9537). 

The Apple situation is kinda unique because they only release several model options to choose from. So of course their sales figures for every model release are gonna be the top highest sellers every year. There ain't direct competition for Apple and no alternatives for an Apple ecosystem user. A much fairer comparison would be between Android OEMs.

The size dilemma is actually much better on the Android side. You still have various alternatives to choose from (albeit a handful) but none on Apple's side. In the fruit garden, You either get a relatively small 6.1' inches or an incredibly large 6.7' and there's no middle ground at all for iOS users. I'm sure there are iPhone users out there that lament why there isn't a 6.3-6.5' model. 

So in a way, you should be grateful that you still have some options, unlike die-hard 3.5mm jack and sd card flagship users."
2050,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,Kyrond,12074,4/11/2023 19:06,"Those decisions aren't made without reason.

People are conditioned to associate larger=better. Even with iPhones, larger costs more and is better.

Surely there is space in the market for one phone with a niche feature, but that's just not how it goes, every midrange phone is (trending to):

punch-hole, OLED 6.5+ inch; 200Mpx main camera, 12/8 Mpx UW, 2 useless cameras; no SD, no jack, latest Wifi, BT and 5G.

At least batteries are getting objectively better."

Hoping Asus do just make a cheaper phone would sell so much more since they're a smaller company to the likes of google and samsung."
2052,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,A_Crow_in_Moonlight,12074,4/11/2023 18:39,"I mean, as you sort of touch on, a major reason why 5.5 inches has gone from phablet to small is the evolution of bezels and aspect ratios. My 7 Pro's 6.7in display is quite a bit larger on paper versus my Nexus 6P's 5.7in, but if you compare the actual sizes they're pretty similar. It's not like the days of chunky bezels on 16:9 panels when a longer diagonal always meant a bigger device."
2053,Samsung Galaxy A34 review,Zerasad,12074,4/11/2023 15:57,"Yea, a Zenfone 10 Lite with a Snapdragon 7XX processor would be the best."

The issue with the high end Exynos is that when the Mongoose cores are pushed to the upper end of their clockspeeds in load they get stupid inefficient and eat up a lot of battery compared to Snapdragon Kyro cores. The excess battery used becomes heat and it throttles. Keep it at below 70% and it's fine. Which becomes stupid since you paid for that extra 30% performance.

Low end Exynos don't go to very high clock speeds and they aren't paired with powerful GPUs. What happens is they're opposite of the upper end. The competition at the low end is mostly Mediatek Helios and Unisoc, which Exynos beats."

It was ""non-user replacable"", which meant to replace the battery, you needed to:

2247,Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max review - GSMArena,majkkali,12548,9/29/2023 0:35,"> Lastly, we did read reports of overheating iPhones, some during fast charging. For this review, we used two iPhone 15 Pro Max units, obtained from different retailers, and neither of those became unbearably hot even after an hour of GPU stress testing. Warm, rather unpleasantly (but not concerningly) - sure, but hot - never. We know people have experienced and documented such issues, but we haven't been able to replicate those so far on our units.

> And since we ran the same tests on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which last year we crowned as a phone with excellent stability, we were surprised to see that now, under iOS 17, its stability has gotten worse. That's why we think there is some software issue at play in addition to/or just contributing to the poor heat dissipation.

This is the main takeaway from the article. Really good and professional review by the way. Thanks for sharing :)"

2252,Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max review - GSMArena,The_Woman_of_Gont,12548,9/29/2023 1:55,">The ultrawide camera also supports dual-pixel autofocus, which comes in handy when you want to shoot macro photos from as close as 3-4cm. As soon as you are really close to a subject, the camera can automatically switch to a macro mode, but it will be with a field of view matching the primary camera. This means that it will crop and then upscale. That's why we prefer to just switch to the UW camera and do it by ourselves.

Sorry, I've not used the macro much yet and this is my first Pro phone since they introduced it....does this mean that it does that weird extra cropping only when the camera auto-switches?  So if I turn macro off, then go to the ultra-wide, I should get a better image out of the mode?"

The feel is nice so is the weight.  The back is easier to break but it is easier to fix.

Still feels solid and premium, but is noticeably more comfortable. The 15 Pro Max felt lighter in hand than my iPhone 13 Pro did, even though I know that it actually isn't. It also helps that titanium just feels warmer to the touch than stainless steel.

What's not an open debate, is that the phones are more fragile this time around, I'm still debating between the pro and the plus, but what is a given, is that I'm always going to have a case in, specially because I will get it in the mexican version of the iPhone Upgrade Program"

But ya im just shocked at how well this 13 pro has held up, build quality is out of this world, just hope the 15 pro is close to this, sounds like the titanium they are using is actually weaker which im, for the first time, actually worried about, but hey ill take a lighter phone"

The alleged leaked roadmap of future iPhone displays in the pic I posted show that the standard models might be getting LTPO displays as soon as 2025, aka the iPhone 17 series. I’m definitely keeping my 13 pro until then and we’ll see if this actually comes to fruition."
2323,Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max review - GSMArena,31337hacker,12548,9/29/2023 3:26,It varies from person to person. Some people can't notice it at all while others notice it and care or don't care.
2324,Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max review - GSMArena,randompersonx,12548,9/28/2023 23:07,"If you hold your phone in your hand and rotate your wrist , there’s a certain amount of resistance to that rotation… your brain uses that as part of its subjective feeling of weight. 

Because steel is heavier than titanium, the weight distribution on the 15 pro max is closer to the center than on the 14 pro max. As a result, the inertia is lower, and the 15 pro max feels even lighter relative to the 14 pro max than it actually is…

It’s immediately noticeable for me, and I appreciate it. 

With that said, it’s certainly not a reason for someone to upgrade alone unless you just have a very large income and won’t notice the difference in your bank account. 

Now, me personally… I’d say that the 15 pro max overall feels like a much bigger upgrade than the 14 pro max was over their respective previous generation… it’s not because of any one change, but the totality of the 5x lens (which is actually a large improvement over the 3x lens), the improved feeling in the hand of the titanium (both weight and inertia, as well as the slightly rounded edges), the new natural titanium color (imho: beautiful), the flexibility of usbc, and all the minor improvements in the camera software (which do add up to a lot overall)… plus the new 5g radio which seems to get about 50% more range from the tower …

It’s a pretty big upgrade if you actually use your phone for photos and videos more than just snapshots… I personally end up posting some videos to YouTube every year or so, but when I do, it’s not unusual for them to get 10s of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of views. To me, the quality is worth it…

To my wife, whose photos and videos will look amateur even if taken with a professional camera, of course it wouldn’t be nearly the difference…"

2326,Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max review - GSMArena,randompersonx,12548,9/28/2023 23:08,"The Ultra is Titanium… IMHO, it feels much more premium than the Stainless of the regular series."

I doubt many people who spent the $$ on an iPhone X (like myself), two years ago, will upgrade. I doubt anyone who is rocking an older phone will go in for the 11. More likely they'll get an 8 or maybe an XR.

The fact is that most people in computer science are straight white males. That’s just reality. Most people in the industry are men, most are straight, and most are white, with some Asian and Indian as well.

The problem is that this “diversity” movement can’t accept that. It can’t accept how things actually are in the industry, and so it wants to push quotas of gay female trans people of color. The movement wants to push minorities into high level positions and into positions as keynote presenters. But there are far fewer of those people, so there’s a much smaller pool to choose from. And when you have a smaller pool of candidates, you’re going to get inferior candidates. That’s just statistics.

So the end result is that pushing for “diversity” means you get inferior people. You get inferior presenters and you get inferior high level employees. That really worries me about the future of the industry. Silicon Valley is so obsessed with diversity that it means it’s no longer higher and promoting the best people.

If you want to encourage women and minorities to go into computer science fields, I fully support that. But when you take a field that is dominated by one group of people and you start artificially promoting minorities groups for the sake of “diversity”, that hurts the entire industry in the long run."

They made lightning port at the time because USB-C wasn't out yet. Technology wise, lightning port is behind USB-C.

They have already converted all their macbooks and iPads to USB-C for that reason. Can act as a thunderbolt, fast charging, and all that. Very powerful and versatile.

I'm on a pixel 2xl for the moment, I usually use iPhones. But it's been so nice that my laptop, my work laptop, my phone, my headphones, and my mouse all use the exact same charger. You always have it! 

Thus I think right now USB-C is a deal breaker in keeping me with an iPhone.

Just out of curiosity, why not look into options like the pixel 3a that cost $400 new MSRP (often cheaper with deals) that's a flagship without the price with support and is going to be faster? 

Always thought one of the benefits of having an iPhone was apples great support that lasts around 5 years after it's released. Huge selling point!"

Hopefully next year will be better. I hope it won't just be 5g, as that's one feature. They seem to just focus on one feature, like the camera. Next year's iPhone is sort of a 2 year project, since this year was incremental. I really hope to see 5.5 inches, no notch, and one camera system instead of 3. FaceID is great but I always find it slower than touchID. You have to swipe after it unlocks, vs touchID instant unlock. I do admire the tech as it is better than the alternative.

And I really hope they work on Siri. It is 5 years behind the rest. I wish if the Money had gone to the products and Siri sections instead of Netflix-like content. Really Apple? Stay in your lane, and make perfect products. If it has its hands in too many things, it'll backfire I think"

2572,"Apple iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max in 24 seconds",,9848,9/13/2019 23:48,"Yeah I know usb c transfers data a little faster, but I don't really need that to be honest. I prefer lightning ports because they are physically more reliable, and fast charging still works fine with them(not that I use it much). The design of the lightning plug itself where its basically just a straight plug fitting into an empty hole, is the most reliable and sturdy design of any plug out there, except for maybe barrel. The usb c has that oval plug that fits around a small protrusion inside the phone, those are susceptible to breaking, bending and wearing out over time. As well as being much harder to clean. Also, my Macbook has the magnetic charge port which I love, and my headphones with usb C have a 30 hour battery life so I literally never charge them except for at my house. Lightning cables being proprietary doesn't really affect me negatively in any way. 

The reason I got an iPhone 8 instead of something like a Pixel are because the only two things that matter to me when it comes to mobile devices are privacy and processing power. Anything android lacks any form of privacy, as google tracks everywhere you go with the device and everything you do. Then they store and sell that information to businesses across the world for advertisement purposes. I will never buy an android or use anything google related, I prefer owning a product not being one. Not to mention the fact that apple devices absolutely blow androids out of the water when it comes to raw processing power. The iPhone 8 effectively has three times as fast single core processing and almost twice as fast processor overall when compared to the 3a.

Having apple support is nice, but I see it as more of an add on than anything and have never used it on any of my devices or extended it beyond one year."

The reason I tend to see the usb-C that way is because I used to work doing field repair of commercial electronics for 7 years. Everything from wireless headsets to televisions to speaker/intercom systems and even phones and other devices I would fix them. Trust me, any port with any sort of prong inside of it *will* break, its just a matter of time. I fucking hate prongs. One of the reasons I bought the iPhone 5s back in the day was because I absolutely could not stand the micro usbs that were on all the feature phones and early android devices at the time.

2671,OnePlus 11 Apreciation Post!,REHTONA_YRT,11893,8/21/2023 15:33,"Right on! I love mine as well.   


I waited a while and hunted deals. Snagged a Titan Black 16/256GB variant for $640 using the Student discount and the OnePlus Store app. It came with a free 125W charger. Got an open box Aramid Fiber case for $27 on Amazon that should arrive today, and used a coupon to get a 80W SuperVooc car charger and cable for $40 shipped.   


Was considering the OnePlus Buds Pro 2's, but I have Airpod Pro Gen 2's and the one thing holding me back is the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 dont have volume control built into the buds and I use an Android Auto screen on my motorcycle that doesn't have bluetooth volume control built in.   


But man alive what a phone for the money. I have had the S21 Ultra, S22 Ultra, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 7 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max previous to this and it blows them all away in terms of day to day use. Apps and webpages never have to reload. Its silky smooth and snappy in both the UI and the apps I use. The charging speeds have changed the way I use my phone every day and all my battery anxiety worries have been put to rest. Its the first Android to give me all day battery life.   


Two things that have stood out that I wasn't expecting, is it has by far the best cell reception in my office. I can actually make and receive calls on LTE now. The second is the audio quality is VERY good even using the same AirPods as I did with other devices. Its cleaner and I feel I can notice more individual sounds and instruments in songs."
2672,OnePlus 11 Apreciation Post!,Nomnom_Chicken,11893,8/21/2023 17:30,"Isn't the best camera phone, but overall a very good device. I got my 256 GB variant for under 600 euros new with some great discount and bringing an old phone that was collecting dust in my drawer. 

The fast charging speed is still something that changes how I use my phone, same was with my 8T too. OOS 13 is extremely smooth, like it was on my 8T too. Due to the overall design of 11, it feels smaller on hand that what it is. Well-balanced weight distribution helps too. 

What I dislike is the extremely slippery body, holy moly. A piece of soap has more grip! :D I bought the green version too, it's rumored to easily develop a crack in the rear glass, near the camera island. Even without much force, some had it happen while their 11 was in a pocket. 

Excited to see what OP 12 brings along. :) Won't be replacing this phone until after some years, but still excited."

Edit copying post from r/OnePlus:

Problem with the OnePlus 10 pro and oppo (same phone these days) is there is no more MSM tool, so any developer runs the risk of bricking their device during testing of any ROM due to the inability to recover their device.

I've installed all the GSI system ROMs but they're missing a lot of features like fingerprint, auto brightness, text receiving, face unlock amongst others so not worth it.

In short, NO there isn't and won't be any custom ROMs for this or any future OnePlus devices."

ColorOS bad. Written on a OnePlus 8T. The software is lacking polish everywhere. The YT PIP animation is broken and I've had the app completely get stuck in a state somewhere between PIP and maximized. Double tapping notifications on the lock screen and using the finger print to unlock the phone after that is broken. The search in the default launcher is a separate app which is terrible for all sorts of reasons. The GPU drivers on my phone have never been updated and are still stuck in 2020. I can't close the app drawer by swiping down again. The status bar icons + notification shade/quick settings look a lot worse than regular Android.

If you're already on 12 and don't have any of those issues, the only issue you might run into is your dual sim no longer working. What I'd say, since you're already on 12, you can either A. wait for others to download the EU F.18 and wait for feedback, or B. backup everything and be prepared to rollback to F.17, but, again, as far as I know the only problem you could face is with dual sim."

It's not before, it's after. You must not have used Android for very long.

This is a problem on EVERY Android phone, on EVERY version of Android, with EVERY skin (including stock), all the way back to Cupcake. Your gripe is with Android, not ColorOS.

Every single Android enthusiast knows about this experience, and knows that a factory reset after a major version upgrade is common good practice. Dirty flashes might be fine for one version, but when you get into multiple, it's time for a factory reset.

The risks you talk about are practically non existent, and wireless charging is way more inefficient. Your Qi charging pad would get heated up much more than your entire phone would by charging for just 20 minutes straight. Thermal energy = power x time. Do I need to mention how much POWER is wasted by Qi chargers, and how LONG (time) they need to charge?

There are absolutely zero risks of your USB Type-C port getting damaged, if you're wondering, unless you're an immensely clumsy person who doesn't handle their phone with the bare minimum care.

""Modern software"" intelligently controlling charging overnight to not degrade the battery, or something, is a pure myth. Even if it wasn't, you can't ever go wrong with the end user being more careful simply by charging only for 20 minutes at a time and not having to worry about it ever again (the OnePlus 11 has great battery life anyway).

If you actually read the context of your own comment, you'll realise I was very specifically talking about leaving your phone on your bed while you're sleeping. I said nothing about the safety of fast charging.

Fast charging isn't going to cause damage or start a fire, because the phone is literally designed for it. Leaving it on your bed overnight (where it could concievably be crushed, thrown in your sleep or just end up between the covers and cook itself, which is the really dangerous one) absolutely could.

The entire point is, you don't need to remember to plug it in if it's always at 100% in the morning and will always last the day. If you don't understand that I don't know what to say at this point."

3113,OnePlus Nord 3 review,,10289,7/6/2023 11:51,I would say 7+ gen 2 is quite similar to dimensity 9000. Although implementation may vary.
3114,OnePlus Nord 3 review,,10289,7/6/2023 11:53,That's a good phone as well. Is roughly 90% as strong in terms of performance.
3115,OnePlus Nord 3 review,manek101,10289,7/5/2023 23:16,Dimensity 9000 is significantly better than G2.

3122,OnePlus Nord 3 review,Kingchin3,10289,7/7/2023 19:51,"The Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 is decent with some cool features built in but it's still a midrange processor.

The MediaTek Dimensity 9000 is a bit better overall than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. Plus doesn't have the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 performance issues that many people complained about. 

MediaTek Dimensity 9000 is a bit behind the improved Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. Which in turn is a bit behind the MediaTek Dimensity 9000+."

3126,OnePlus Nord 3 review,manek101,10289,7/6/2023 9:10,What? Both Antutu and Geekbech scores of Nord 3 are about 25% higher than the tensor
3127,OnePlus Nord 3 review,set4bet,10289,7/6/2023 9:00,"At this point, using early reviews of a year old chips is useless. You can go buy real world perfomance by now and G2 is not great. Early reviews praised the chip to be better than G1 in reality the phones with G2 gets really hot out of nowhere multiple times per day and can drain your phone while doing so. Trust me I have Pixel 7 and the SoC is the worst thing about the phone (together with underwhelming fps). 

I had the opportunity to try Nord 3 and Dimensity 9000 was more seamless and more power efficient while having better and faster fps."
3128,OnePlus Nord 3 review,noneym86,10289,7/6/2023 4:14,"Yeah agreed and that's the first thing I noticed too. But pretty much everything else is pretty smooth. And a sidenote, after coming from iPhone for years, RCS is actually fucking cool. I wish Apple would adapt and make messaging globally a breeze."
3129,OnePlus Nord 3 review,Bouzoo,10289,7/6/2023 6:49,"For me it never felt clunky, just slow. Set the animation speed from 1x to 0.5 in developer settings. You can't go back after that."

3134,OnePlus Nord 3 review,Sheshirdzhija,10289,7/6/2023 11:10,"Ok thanks. I assume battery life hit is big, otherwise oneplus would not set this to default."
3135,OnePlus Nord 3 review,manek101,10289,7/7/2023 7:45,"Maybe they realise that kind of performance is only needed while using specific apps and games and is useless waste of energy in day to day scrolling?   
I mean 700k on Antutu, 1000 on GSC can handle Instagram and reddit just fine.  
Its when you want to launch genshin impact or Apex legends that you want the OC to kick in, which game mode already does automatically, if it doesn't, or you're using a non gaming heavy app, use performance mode."

3137,OnePlus Nord 3 review,Sheshirdzhija,10289,7/6/2023 13:18,So 7gen2 is definitely better here.
3138,OnePlus Nord 3 review,manek101,10289,7/6/2023 15:38,"On paper, if we just look at the CPU, both are identical except clock speeds peak on Mediatek are higher. 
Both being on TSMC 4nm would mean that both will perform similarly in terms of efficency if 9000  is underclocked, like it is here"
3139,OnePlus Nord 3 review,Sheshirdzhija,10289,7/7/2023 4:53,"Sure, but maybe 7gen2 is easier to optimize for has better drivers? Or any oem might not optimize ideally?"

1.Perhaps energy modes or code optimization for Oxigen/Dimensity 9000. Too poor for 5000mA, and how hot it can get thanks to those extra megaherz of the single core SoC. 

  
2. Video stabilization. Current one is just very low end.  


Both are notoriously needed for a phone of that rounds 500€.

3195,OnePlus Nord CE3 Lite or Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro?,tirthdesai,11977,8/19/2023 6:35,Nord ce3 lite. Atleast ui is bloatware n ad free
3196,bad stock camera for oneplus Nord ce3 lite,i-am-vr,11977,6/19/2023 10:37,"I find the processing of the stock camera as rubbish on my Nord CE and was searching for better alternatives for about an year. These are the alternatives I use, and I think they may work for you as well. Remember that none of these are a solid replacement for the stock camera app, all these need some level of manual inputs, tuning, editing etc., but they give much much better results than the stock camera, if you put in the time.

**Motion Cam** \- (available on playstore) this has become my primary app for shooting photos (casual, daytime, indoor, portraits etc.). I mostly shoot RAW + JPG in this. It has custom sliders for contrast, sharpness, saturation etc. The RAW coming from this is better than what you  get from stock, because it has an option to apply noise reduction to the RAW. The JPGs, with some tuning can be really good too. 

**GCam** \- you will most definitely find one that works on yourr phone. Try this one, it works on mine = > [Gcam apk + samples](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yp8ro4xnb3h9dad/AABYUgf0fHxWzN3JcriR8ON_a?dl=0) . If not, search the internet a bit. It can give great results, HDR is amazing, captures a TON of dynamic range - especially in the RAW images. However, I find the processing a bit unnatural, especially the skintones, so i stick to Motion Cam for photos.  I still use it for night time, dark scenes. GCam has no match for night shooting. On my phone, this also supports 4K with video stabilization (only on the main camera) and output at 100Mbps - excellent quality video, with no oversharpening.

**Open Camera**  \- (available on playstore) I use this for shooting video primarily (but doesnt have stabilization), with manual control, on all cameras. Gives excellent 100Mbps video, has many resoltion options, with no oversharpening. Photos are okayish, the RAW photos suffer a magenta tint pushed to -150 in lightroom, so I dont really use it for RAW capture."

With the decent design, the phone looks quite good, but the overall performance of this phone by Oneplus fails to meet up the user expectations thus creating a bad significance. In the matter of the potentiality or the phone’s productivity towards the work operations, the snapdragon chipset is a bad choice that is integrated with the phone to give a negative impression and thus create bad limitations. In the aspect of the One Plus Nord series, this device that falls under this category tends to create a poor potentiality and lower performance rate which is quite potential."

With the aspect of the Snapdragon chipset that is integrated into this phone, there is a poor performance that is mainly associated with multitasking that creates a negative effect and disadvantages. This Nord version is not at all worth it with the aspect of so many problems and the limitations that are associated with this device.

It's below the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 or even the older Snapdragon 870.

Wonder if OnePlus has heavily underclocked the chip or is using poorly-binned chips which failed QC for the full-powered Dimensity 9000.

It's a concern - OnePlus similarly underclocked the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 used in the 11R launched recently (3.05/2.5/1.8) GHz vs. (3.2/2.75/1.8) GHz."

Maybe you don't use your phone as much or something, but everyone who uses their phone a lot, reading, watching videos/netflix, instagram, etc (which is billions of people) want a bigger screen so they can see all of that easier. Reading on a 6.7"" phone is MUCH better than a 5.9"" phone."

A lot of other companies are also using 6.7 as well. Realme 11 Pro+ is 6.7. Samsung went big too with A34 although that's 6.6. Oppo Reno 10s are also 6.7 inches. Some of new Xiaomis phones are also 6.7.

&#x200B;

So the question is not why are they using 6.7. The question is why is Google's Pixel 7A only 6.1 inches. But I'm telling you right now Google will go bigger and everyone else is gonna keep doing 6.7 or maybe even bigger phones."

Apple's SE line is on an *at least* once-every-two-years update cycle. It's also not selling well compared to mainline iPhones.

As for Asus, what Asus? They're like Sony Xperia - they hardly ever exist outside of SEA.

Small phones have a lot going for them - but they don't sell. The user is effectively *overpaying* for smallness, which even for iPhones is a bitter pill to swallow."

Its when you want to launch genshin impact or Apex legends that you want the OC to kick in, which game mode already does automatically, if it doesn't, or you're using a non gaming heavy app, use performance mode."

1.Perhaps energy modes or code optimization for Oxigen/Dimensity 9000. Too poor for 5000mA, and how hot it can get thanks to those extra megaherz of the single core SoC. 

  
2. Video stabilization. Current one is just very low end.

Always keep it over 10% or preferably 20%

Charge to 80% and if you need more for traveling etc then charge 100% on special occasions.

This is for all Li-Po batteries, not just OnePlus.

30 min 0-100% charging on a 5000 mAh battery is so crazy, I question it every time like really? 100% already? No way!,
Size is big and perfect as compared to Samsung S22 ultra just doesn't feel right in the hands (in my opinion),
High Resolution, higher refresh rate and better sound are so nice as well,
More memory and more storage for a very reasonable price,
Alert slider is back!,
Overall everything the company stood for before the whole OnePlus 10 fiasco is back!"

Edit: [A benchmark comparison](https://www.phonearena.com/news/snapdragon-8-gen-1-vs-snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-benchmarks-battery_id142878), notice the battery%. The new 8 Gen 2 on the 11 is even more powerful but still more efficient than the 8 Gen 1."

Don't use the weird format because you won't be able to send it anyone who doesn't have a 10pro.

Wireless charging and complete waterproofing was omitted to reduce the price of the product.
They have been doing that since OnePlus 6t after surveying the community on what they want? 
Lower pricing and performance or wireless charging, IP (something) rating and high price.

I still charge it by my bed and love the auto charge feature which studies my usage times and slow charges the phone when it suspects that I'm sleeping...so it doesn't hurt the battery.

Fast refresh rate and nice screen. I never notice the phone lagging or anything, I think the cameras are pretty great and they have fun camera modes. 

Has the ring/vibrate/silent slider which is fine if you like that, I actually find it annoying I can't put my phone on silent from the volume slider alone.

The 65 watt charging is amazing. I can forget to charge my phone at night, it will last through the night to the next morning no problem, then go from like 20% to 100% in a 20 minute morning routine.

And yeah, the battery algorithm (computing engine thing) definitely takes its course. As others suggested in other battery specific posts, the best thing to do is turn all apps you use daily to not optimize, turn off adaptive battery, ram boost, ram expansion etc. Lock apps in memory that you want open, as opposed to letting the algorithm learn it.

In fact, it's even recommended by OnePlus that even if you're at 100% charged, you should let your phone plugged in for like 2 more hours. Because even if it's at 100% you can see that it's still saying ""charging"", it always stops charging 30min after it's full at 100%. 

I can't list you all the optimisations I've done on my phone because it would be too long and I'm too tired right now sorry.. Maybe later I'll edit this comment.

3561,Terrible Battery Life with the OnePlus 10 Pro,Zaekil,11234,7/31/2023 18:38,"I know OnePlus doesn't make great improvements in software for battery life, but this guy has clearly something eating up all this battery, I've never seen someone with that kind of battery going down so quickly. I would suggest him to do a full factory wipe/reset and only keep essential apps to see if it still continues. He's even in battery saving mode, that's just insane. If none of it works, then it's a battery defect.

Btw : I have great battery life and I always use the phone at auto resolution mode + 120hz, so I really don't understand, the things I've changed is turning off everything the phone could use when at sleep, like showing the fingerprint reader when you lift the phone, double tap to wake up the phone, all of these things keep the display or the accelerometers inside the phone active when put to sleep. I also have done some changes in settings which are hard to find and I don't remember all I've done. The other important thing I've done is putting EVERY app non important in no auto launch mode, no running in background nor in ""foreground"" (didn't know how to say in english : apps running in ""premier plan""), turned off their notifications and setting them in optimised mode too. I've also never installed facebook (which drains the battery of every phone, not just OnePlus), only installed messenger lite and managed it to consume less battery. The last thing to check is account synchronisation, I've turned off everything not important like Gmail, play books etc, just keeping the essentials, like contacts, agenda etc. (I always go into gmail and manually actualise it to see the new mails, I always check my mails twice a day or more so I don't need notifications for that."

You really should reset your phone and if it doesn't solve the problem then contact OnePlus about it. 

btw try to uninstall facebook, if you still want to use it, just create a shortcut from chrome to facebook and use facebook on chrome so that it doesn't run in background (facebook is the worst optimised application I've ever seen and a huge battery life monster eater as well)"

I just recently made a piece with a gorgeous deep blue colour on my sharply calibrated TFT panel that just looked black on OLED. OLED also has colour/black crush at low brightness, has a terrible viewing angle and is just not worth all that for true black.

EDIT: not to even mention burn-in, headache inducing tendencies or that you need 30% higher resolution compared to a TFT screen the same size to make it look good."

Oddly enough, this wasn't my first oled phone. Apparently my n81 had it. Always wondered why it looked better than the n95. I did notice that the blacks were a bit of an issue back then as well."
3599,A layman's review of the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G.,Suikerspin_Ei,11344,8/4/2022 11:12,"I think those issues really depends on the OLED panels, I never had issues with my Samsung S6 and S8, both has AMOLED displays. Now the experience are different with the OnePlus 8 Pro, tiny bit of green tint and black crush in specific conditions (at a dark environment and low screenbrightness). I believe latest panels of Samsung doesn't have this issue anymore.

Never experienced burn-in, probably because Samsung use a technique to move the pixels a bit and OnePlus moving the AOD clock from time to time. Or I have just some luck."

3601,A layman's review of the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G.,unnaturely_ugly,11344,6/16/2022 16:40,"Samsung Galaxy A22 5G - prone to hardware issues (anecdotal though), 90Hz LCD display, only 15W charging, runs OneUI Core instead of actual OneUI, inferior cameras, has bloatware, update schedule is **very** iffy, performs much, much worse than this phone and is slightly more expensive than it. But yes, it does have NFC, so I guess if you only care about NFC and don't really care for hardware, go for it.

Samsung Galaxy A03s - comes with much, much lesser RAM (3 and 4 gigs respectively) and isn't even in the same category performance wise. It's also prone to severe hardware faults, isn't that durable, has no official update schedule. But this is much, much cheaper than the OP Nord CE 2 Lite 5G, and comes much cheaper at only 132$, so I guess if you're willing to settle for the tradeoffs and only want NFC (the implementation here is kinda iffy) and are on a budget, go for this one.

Other Galaxy phones (particularly the M series) are prone to hardware issues, run OneUI Core, don't have proper update schedules and have heating and battery issues.

Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro - Proximity sensor, software, hardware issues (particularly one with the storage system on the Indian version), MIUI update schedule is very, very iffy, and it also costs the same as the OP Nord CE 2 Lite, but does have NFC.

Nobody I know of uses Xperia phones so I can't comment on that.

So you were right. OnePlus definitely skimped out on this particular model, but I believe most phones at this price-point with NFC come with huge tradeoffs, that basically hamper day-to-day usage (or atleast thats what my friends and family report, remember this is all anecdotal.)"

Green line issue is suspected to be due to heat. As a precaution before starting the update, charge the phone to 80% or more and let it cool down.

OnePlus has opted for a MediaTek Dimensity 1200 processor which has been somewhat customised with additional AI processing power to create the Dimensity 1200-AI, according to both companies. This is also a little surprising since other OnePlus devices so far have been powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors. There are 6GB, 8GB, and 12GB RAM options, with 128GB of storage for the lower two and 256GB on the highest one. Storage is non-expandable and the Nord 2 5G only has two Nano-SIM slots with support for dual 5G. There is also support for WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, NFC, and five satellite navigation systems. The Nord 2 5G packs in a 4,500mAh battery and comes with a Warp Charge 65W charger in the box.  
The OnePlus Nord 2 5G runs OxygenOS 11.3 based on Android 11. My unit had the June Android security patch. The UI is clean and only a few Google and OnePlus apps, plus Netflix, were preinstalled. I did not have any issues navigating through the UI and found it to be intuitive to use."

The one that’s available in UK (/HK with same specs) is the 8T. I’m not sure if the same gcam mod etc will work on 9R, and gcam really makes the low ish light picture quality better.

I’d avoid 9 series and s21 for all the overheating issues with the snapdragon 888.

8T and Nord 2 are the same price in the UK right now for 12+256GB so I’d be more inclined to get the flagship 8T with the much more common snapdragon 865. Most fe models should have the snapdragon 865 as well, but exynos models do exist from before they replaced the exynos cause it was awful. UK Amazon lets you choose.

Some countries only get 1 year of Samsung warranty instead of 2, and a load of S20 phones started getting wrecked screens after the June update. Anyone who didn’t have the warranty anymore, Samsung just told them to go fuck themselves.

The FE may also have the exploding camera glass issue of the S20 series and Samsung didn’t take responsibility for that either.

It did have touch screen sensitivity issues as well, though those may have been fixed by a software update.


Samsung phones and flagship Oneplus phones will get 3 android version upgrades and 4 years of security updates (nords get 2 and 3), so 8T is the only one that will go to android 14 since it launched with 11.

Also, it has a micro SD slot for memory expansion, as well as wireless charging.

A better package overall, than both - Nord 2 and OP8T, in my opinion.
Only letdowns are slow charging (25W max, comes with 15W brick&cable) and, in my view, One UI look. I feel like plastic back is a plus, since it's harder to break, even if it scratches more easily.
One UI came a long way, it's a good, stable skin, but I don't like the way it looks.

3697,OnePlus Nord 2 5G launch megathread,waldamy,10960,7/22/2021 16:22,"The guy doesn't seem to really know what he's talking about - take efficiency and TDP, for example. He is starting, that sd780G is much more efficient at 5nm process, and thus consumes only 5W of power. While 1200 Ai is at 6nm, so it's less efficient and consumes 10W of power. This is not entirely true, as 1200Ai actually has a higher core frequency for each of its cores, compared to 780G - this is the main reason for higher TDP of the processor, rather then the manufacturing node with a step of 1nm.

I would take these concerns about overheating and battery with a grain of salt, till we see actual user reviews. The main problem here might be ROM development, since Mediatek don't release the source code, unlike snapdragon, thus it's harder for developers to do something.

But we'll also see that down the line. If you don't need a custom ROM, you shouldn't worry about that."

So, yeah, I really miss Oneplus, and I think in large part that is due to their software.


Is ColourOS that different?"

Good screen, great battery, good cameras. If you are playing games - S20 FE will be double the performance, is that and wireless charging worth 150€ to you? Only you can say that.

3766,OnePlus 9 pro worth it in 2022?,joystickd,10806,3/24/2022 9:10,"If you've never used OnePlus devices before it is a great phone.

I got one in January and the screen alone puts it above all competitors.

Cameras are great also, watch actual camera enthusiast reviews on them, not techtubers who are jacks of all trades and master's of none.
Only the telephoto lens is weak. The wide and ultrawide sensors capture detail like no other phone, except maybe the 9 Pro's sibling the Oppo find X3 Pro.

Battery life isn't stellar but has improved with android 12.

Physical design is super premium and very strong, unlike the OnePlus 10 Pro unfortunately.

Also no headphone jack or Micro SD slot is a negative for me but for the price, it's a lot of phone.

I wouldn't pay too much attention to the whiners on here. Android 12 is great on the 9 Pro if all you want is a close-ish to stock, clean UI and a functional phone for life's day to day."
3767,OnePlus 9 pro worth it in 2022?,,10806,3/24/2022 8:05,"I actually got mine this January and I think it's worth it. Got mine around 600$. Battery life got better with Android 12 c47, but it's still not as good as other smartphones of its caliber.

6-6.5 hours of normal use with light gaming, social media apps, YouTube, Netflix with 40-50% screen brightness because I find it bright enough indoors.

4-4.5 hours of heavy gaming sessions (CODm and similar) with 40-50% screen brightness indoors as well

2.5 hours of 4G use with 90-100% screen brightness outdoors (YouTube and Social Media). Mind you it throttles so much if its sunny. If it's not sunny, it can go up to 4 hours with minor throttling. Definitely lower if 5G.

For some reason the 4k 60fps option takes 10 seconds to fully work without frame drops, so you'd wait for a few seconds after opening it then you can press record with no problem.

Some features are removed when you upgrade it to 12.

I find that the Screen-off gestures would sometimes go off even though you don't intend to use it, just be careful. I turn my Draw a V to open flash and sometimes I'd just put my phone on the side and see that my flash is on. Double tap to wake sometimes does not work so I turned it off because it bugs me (no pun intended)

Recently I noticed that the screen would show static lines and one time the entire screen just went static when I was watching Netflix, but this only happens if I turned on video motion enhancement.

I still find it worth it ha ha."
3768,OnePlus 9 pro worth it in 2022?,MicoRed,10806,3/24/2022 12:10,"Hi guys! First of all I'm not a fanboy of any brand, and every year I analyze what best suits my needs in terms of design and functionality. That being said, I'm very pleased with my OP 9 Pro so far, and I have the phone since June last year, and for me, is the closest to perfection as one could ask from a premium phone. Design is subjective, but I love the silver model with all the round and small lens on the back, which remind me the analogic dials from the retro cameras, and I think OP went with that inspiration too, promoting the Hasselblad partnership and the trip to the moon theme. Pair this model with the official carbon case, and you have one pretty retro and cool bad ass phone. I actually bought the Marshall Mode II TWS which have that retro look with the faux black leather to match the same vibe.

Regarding all else, the screen is just gorgeous, one of the best you can find on any phone with rich colors and deep blacks. Everytime I look to the screen I'm amazed, really. Is like typing in a painting canvas wrapped in glass. Responsiveness of the screen is the best I had on any phone, with zero lag, and the haptic feedback feels great. Battery is good not great. I can manage to squizz the battery juice with normal use until night time, and that's fine for me, because you can charge the phone with OP wireless charger in a blink of an eye, so for me that's not an issue. The battery duration is within normal parameters, I cannot fault it.

Never had a problem with overheating, and the processor is very fast and snappy. The main camera and ultra wide are top grade, very competent and reliable. I don't think is worth to upgrade to the OP 10 Pro. Sound is also very good, with clean phone calls and nice stereo clarity from the front speakers. Just to wrap it up, I had a complain regarding the new Oxygen 12 skin, which is a step back from the 11, but I'm very pleased right now using the Lawnchair 12 Alpha 15 release, which is even better than Oxygen 11, in my opinion. Now I have everything I need software wise, a clean launcher, close to stock android, and bloatware free. Zero complains right now!

This is my honest opinion from my experience with OP so far. I normally change phones every year, but I will keep this phone more than usual, and that is saying a lot...👌"

3777,OnePlus 9 pro worth it in 2022?,RynoThePirate,10806,3/24/2022 17:55,I just bought one to replace my 8T which I absolutely loved. I dunno if my is bloated or broken but it's slower and the battery doesn't last nearly as long. My 8T was 2 years old as well this phone drains probably 1.5x as fast. I'm looking into what I can do to stop that.
3778,OnePlus 9 pro worth it in 2022?,Hayekr,10806,3/24/2022 21:00,"It's definitely worth it.  Remember, a lot of the flagship phones coming out this year by manufacturers are merely incremental improvements over the flagships of 2021.  This is true for the OP10Pro.  Just comparing the specs of the two shows there's no compelling reason to spend hundreds of dollars more for a phone that is marginally better.  If you can get a good deal on an OP9Pro, it's worth it IMO.   I switched to Tmobile recently and got mine literally free because I switched, and I am very satisfied.  I am sticking with Android 11 and not installing any updates for the foreseeable future, which seems to be the main complain.  

The only downsides to the phone for me is the unnecessary curved screen, and the fact it runs a little warm.  Battery life is fine for me but I am particular on disabling background apps.  

My assumption is the price will drop even more once the OP10Pro comes out in the US this month.  Might be worth it to wait longer unless you want to go with the Tmobile deal."

Only way to make it less power hungry would be for OnePlus to clock the SoC down and then guess what? It would perform very bad in terms of performance and everyone would say - "" its shitty OS and a company digging its own grave""

I mean im not defending them, its just that they can't do anything about it other than compromising between performance/battery and that's what they have done.

Either way, Download accubattery and cpu spy and see if your phone goes to deep sleep properly and check what app uses the battery.

Something is messing up, and it always comes down to a bad app and or bad optimization of that app specifically for the phone model in question

And by the way if you changed battery without factory reseting the phone it might still act as if the battery is degraded and it thinks that 70% is fully 100% charged."

3841,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,Skitzenator,10161,7/25/2020 19:27,"The comparison between the 8 and the 7t is somewhat unfair IMO, as most will likely not be cross-shopping them because of the price disparity. The 7t is slower although not by a huge margin; the battery is smaller and thus gives less battery life, but it isn't a world of difference; and concerning the software support, the 7t launched with Android 10 just like the 8, if we go by true OnePlus promises both will be supported to Android 12, the only thing the 8 gets is half a year longer of security patches, which isn't a major selling point IMO. (This is based of OnePlus's official statements, but OnePlus has been generous with updates before, so who really knows?)

I definitely don't agree with your verdict. The 7t is 90% the phone the 8 is and going for it instead of the 8 will net you a cool 200€ which you can invest in an accessory or just stick in your pocket. Versus its similarly priced rivals the 8 is  perhaps a good deal when you compare the 865 to the 765G most phones have for around the 8's price, but you'd still have to completely forget the existence of the 7t at 499€.

(PS I mean absolutely no offence with this response, and I apologize if I came of a bit harsh, but this part of your review REALLY bothered me. Other than that it's a great review and I'm not hating on you because of your preference for the 8, I hope you have as much fun with it as I have with my 7t. :)    )"

While the phone is heavier and not to my liking esthetically, it does take some great photos as long as there's enough light. Indoors / in the dark photos have not been amazing and the new portrait mode is not as good. It automatically zooms a lot into the subject and while the photos look great on a phone, they don't seem focused / sharp once you zoom in.. not sure what happened with this portrait mode. I suppose they thought too many people don't understand you need to get close for a good portrait. What I like is how fast it is and how amazing colours look on the screen. In the beginning I was under the impression each photo I looked at had been shot with an incredible camera until I realised I just had a better screen than with the 6T. Verdict- this time I'm not 100% sure it was worth spending that much money on a new oneplus. Sounds like people were way more happy when the 7T came out."

Photos are so so on my OP 5.

Group texts/ MMS, has been an issue on my OnePlus 5.
Second most annoying issue I've had is the vibration motor for notifications since I only have sound on for notifications ~5% of the time.

If I have to deal with these same issues on the OP 8, I might pass. Also, I would prefer pics aren't massive which when you have a 48MP camera those pics take up space fast! Anything over 15MP seems unnecessary.

I got a galaxy s5 back in the day around the time the s6 launched, and I'd argue that the s5 aged better than the s6. 

Additionally, how can you recommend the 128/8 instead of the 256  variant universally? I personally use more than 128 on my phone, so 128 is out of the picture. 

>don't compare with last generation one plus

why not? the 7 pro (IMO) was and still is the best android phone ever made. It doesn't have the screen QC issues that the 8 pro and s20 seem to suffer from, it has no hole punch and is 1440p unlike the op8, and (subjectively) I think that the back of the 8 series doesn't look as nice as the 7 pro- both the 8 and 8 pro have the weird font for the branding, and the 8 pro has the unsymmetrical layout. 

>the most used cameras are primary and ultrawide

again, this comes down to how the user uses the phone. I personally use the zoom lens more on my 7 pro than I use the ultrawide. 

That's just my two cents"

3880,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,Mike161972,10161,7/25/2020 23:29,"Performance wise I'd agree that the 7t is almost as good of a phone for less. BUT, design/looks wise and form factor I think you could say the 8 is objectively better. Looks and form factor do play a role. I can't do the tear notch. Hole punch is easier to swallow. Not to mention that camera design on the 7t. If these two phones looked identical then yeah it would be wise to save money and go with the 7t, but one just looks so much better than the other. Saving $200 won't stop me from regretting that I didn't get the 8 over the 7t if I'm gonna be using it for the next 2-3 years."
3881,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,chanmanm8,10161,7/26/2020 12:00,"I ended up going for (and received yesterday) my first OP phone and love it: 7T Pro McLaren. The 5g version and unlocked. The seller had barely used it for 5 days and went back to his other high end phone cuz he didn't like the curved glass. Got the full kit and 3 cases on a mint condition phone for 625. 1 year insurance (eBay) and expedited shipping brought the whole cost to just under $700.

I almost got the pro and really wanted to wait for the 8T series in October, but my previous garbage phone was dying. And then reading about the display issues of 8 plus how 7 had the popup camera, and McLaren has 12 GB ram, I went to look for a deal for a few days.

 The seller posted his perfect condition and barely used phone Wednesday at that price (phone, full kit, unlocked which usually costs around $50 to do from what I read, 3 extra cases and screen protectors, and he paid to insure the mailing)."
3882,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,nish2311,10161,7/25/2020 20:51,"7T has been one of the most successful and most liked phone of OnePlus. My considerations while buying were OP 8, 7T, Samsung S10 lite and Note 10 lite. My father advised me to go for the newest technology available and there's no doubt that OP 8 hasn't imporved on many areas of 7T other than a Telephoto lens which I know after a few clicks, I would have never used just like the 8's Macro lens. 7T is a fantastic phone and 8 is just a more polished version of it. The price difference is always debatable. I felt the extra I am paying will be benefecial for me in the long run so went with it."

3884,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,EvoRalliArt,10161,7/26/2020 10:46,Pretty much summarised everything why I chose a 7T over the regular 8. I even got the 7T twice and returned the first one after I was waiting to see what the regular 8 had in store. Disappointed so got the 7T again.
3885,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,nish2311,10161,7/25/2020 21:08,"7T came with somewhat low expectations but as it kept many features of 7 pro, it was a big hit. 8 series is a very refined version of the 7 series. Though 7T pro is still a fantastic phone to buy if one cares for looks and screen quality. Please wait for a stable Gcam version and future phone updates. OnePlus has a history of improving a lot over its updates. 7T is the best example of that."

3901,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,nish2311,10161,7/26/2020 13:06,"Curved screen is very subjective. Camera wise OnePlus is way behind Google, Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Sony. People buy OnePlus only for its overall performance and I think every single phone of OnePlus has been successful in that."
3902,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,nish2311,10161,7/26/2020 19:43,"Nearest Samsung competitors to OP 8 is the S 10 series (10,  10+, e and Lite). Other than OP 8, only other option I considered was S10 Lite. My advantages of choosing the former were 90Hz display, Oxygen OS, best chipset available and better software support. Advantage of S 10 series over OP 8 are better screen quality, cameras and Samsung Pay. I felt OP 8 suited more of my needs so went with it. My experience has been amazing and after a month of usage, I am still finding tiny details of Oxygen OS which amazes me. 

OP 8 is definitely not the best phone available but is a very safe option to go for which doesn't disappoints yet sometimes leaves you wanting for something more like  the cameras."
3903,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,nish2311,10161,7/27/2020 6:26,"There's a huge price difference between OP 8 and iPhone 11 back in India. Here OP 8 and iPhone SE 2020 are in the same price bracket. Even the OP 8 Pro is priced considerably less than iphone 11. So for us back here there was no comparison between the two phones. The nearest competitor price wise to iphone 11 is Samsung S 20 series. 

For your reference price of iPhone 11 is Rs 69000, OP 8 starts at Rs 42000, OP 8 Pro is Rs 55000, SE 2020 is Rs 42500 and S 20 is Rs 70000. 

Also camera wise iPhone 11 is superior to OP 8 and there will always be this iOS vs Android debate. So whatever is the pricing in your country, you can choose accordingly.

Though the vibration motors in OP 8 is pretty strong. They have improved in comparison to OP 6."
3904,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,nish2311,10161,7/26/2020 7:03,There will always be a better one available no matter how much money one puts it. I bought iphone 7 when 8 was available and 6s was still good to go but it lasted me a good almost 3 years. In the end its always personal choice. My sister's OP 6 is still an excellent phone and will be strong for at least a year and a half. I do sometimes feel if I would have gone for 7T Pro for a full display or 8 Pro for one the best phone available or could have also waited for the Nord which is a good phone too. All of them are excellent phones including my Onyx Black OP 8 128/8 variant.
3905,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,nish2311,10161,7/25/2020 21:01,"If you are ready to buy OnePlus's wireless charger then only it would make sense as other chargers will be slow. The charger provided, charges the phone by 1 hour. OnePlus has put in the necessary seals for water resistance they just didn't bothered to get an official certification. Using my old iphone 7 feels like crap after using 90Hz in this phone. I felt, the difference is really huge. OnePlus 8 pro has everything one can ask for in a phone, if you have the budget go for it. Else 8 is a fantastic phone too. The display will be slightly more punchier in 8 Pro but the curved screen will be more prone to accidental touch. If you want one beast of a phone go for 8pro and if you can be happy with little compromises which you ll forget about soon, go for 8."
3906,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,DarkMaskx,10161,7/26/2020 19:23,Oneplus 8 pros seem to have a lot of display issues recently...so if u r gonna go with 8pro id say check that out and then make a decision.... also i dont think 999$ is fair for 8pro....  and 700 to 800$ for 8 like in US....if thats the case going for 7T pro makes much sense.... but if u wanna go for 8pro nontheless ... if you can wait and potentially get even a 100$ off of it.(like 800$ or so).that would be close to perfect price imo...
3907,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,Skitzenator,10161,7/26/2020 7:20,Totally true. Qualcomm really screwed everyone over royally by only making the 865 available with the 5g modem.

3910,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,Skitzenator,10161,7/26/2020 11:01,"Jeez, that's either a really good price for the 8 or a really bad price for the 7t. Anyhow, where I live, a 7t is 200€ cheaper which is quite a heap of money, so the 7t makes more sense, but in your situation, yeah totally take the 8."
3911,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,Skitzenator,10161,7/26/2020 2:55,"I wouldn't say the design of the 8 is ""objectively"" better than that of the 7t, some parts did improve absolutely, like the camera bump. But the 8 has a curved screen, which is very polarising, some hate it (like myself) because of accidental touches, others love it because of the elegant look. It's not better nor worse than the 7t. When it comes to the tear drop Vs the hole punch it is 100% subjective. Some (like yourself) like the hole punch because it's less intrusive, I prefer the notch because it's symmetrical. Other than that, the only real difference in form factor is that the 8 is 2 millimeters narrower, which is basically negligible. So form factor is a pretty lousy point when comparing the two, because yes, it did improve in certain areas but other decisions about the design are questionable to say the least."

Massive improvement. Bigger screen, 90hz, better cameras and most importantly for me, massive improvement in battery life.
My S8 would drain so quickly, I always had to take a charger with me to work, battery pack for in the car, etc
With my 7T I can use it heavily and do have enough battery at the end if the day that it just needs a top up."
3914,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,chris141,10161,7/26/2020 0:16,"I upgraded from my s8+ to my OP8, and I dont hink there is a big difference in the software. I thought i was going to appreciate the 'clean' software but its barely a noticbale change from my s8+. The screen is nice, lower resoloution than my s8+ but higher refresh, which i dont really notice. One feature that i didnt appreicate from my s8+ is the light detector ( on the front of the phone) which auto dims the screen when its dark. It's quite annoying opening your phone and having to change the brightness down or up when required. 

The main difference for me is the camera.  I tried yesterday taking photos outside in my garden at night and the image is rubbish. Compared to the s8+ camera which i thought did well at low light photos. Evene when the camera is taking photos in daylight iit is stilll not as good. I'm really dissapointed in this aspect the most. The cheaper nord has 6 cameras, but as they are based on the op8 cameras i dont have much hope.

The pros are that the fast charging, its amazing having a 70%+ charge in 30 mins or so. 

My s8+ was fine until i dropped it and cracked the screen, which is why i decided to upgrade to the op8."
3915,Review of OnePlus 8 after using the phone for 1 month.,nish2311,10161,7/25/2020 21:20,"If you like the Samsung ecosystem then S10 lite is a good phone too or you can wait for the S20 fan edition. 3 years is pretty long life for a mobile phone and with the technology evolving so fast, even the current generation phones will be felt to be old in the next 3-4 months. Currently at the price segment, OP 8 is an excellent phone. Oxygen OS is one of the best to use. If you want to use a OnePlus phone, you won't regret choosing any between 7T, 7T pro, 8 and 8 pro.You jusy have to decide a budget. I had considered all of them and 8 suited my all requirements so went with it."

What I meant is that newest doesn't always mean most longest life. For example, the oneplus one has seen much more life out of it than the oneplus 2, the s5 had more than the s6, the pixel 2 seems to be doing better than the 3, the 6s definitely did better than the 7, etc.

Did you perform a battery swap?.
Did you notice anything like unusual battery drain. Or random rebooting. This could have been an indicator that the battery was defective and was reaching end of it's life.

 From what I can see it the picture there was a catastrophic loss of containment. I still can't figure out what could have triggered it.  It's very unsettling to think that a device we use constantly can just explode.

I have heard cases where the main cause of the battery failure was actually the adhesive that keeps the battery attached to the frame. After couple of years heating and cooling. It becomes brittle and is capable of causing damage to the batteries."

2) probably defective cables
3) leaving it in your bed

These aren't great for it in the long run. I've had phones over heat over the last 20 or so years, but never one catching fire.

You need to do a few changes.

1) Openly charge your phone. This will help with heat transfer.
2) buy better cables, not oneplus specifically, but decent ones that cost more than 2 - 10 euro/ 2-10 dollars. Something with better cable sleves
3) leaving on a side table - pretty much point 1 again.


This said, that's really shitty and not phone and very dangerous. They should have surge protection or stop charging due to over heating

I know my 8t shuts down at high temperatures. But I didn't know about the pro. I do have smart charge set up, I use official oneplus blocks and cables and keep mine in the open. So far no issues of phones catching fire even my dodgy early era android phones on the 2000s"

Things like that. All I'm doing is accessing the picture and videos.

And you're right wood is very flammable, depending on the conditions as well. You're wooden table won't catch on fire in the cold as it would in the summer (from my experience as someone who like outdoor fires in the winter).

And agreed you pocket is also made of material that can catch fire, but you're not usually charging your phone in your pocket right? There are several factors that would need to be looked at.

And honestly when the Samsung phones started catching fire, I really started paying attention to the manufacturers guidelines of usage and battery usage.

No company is perfect, but oneplus still need to do better, but also we as the consumers need to listen and understand that phones will catch fire under the right circumstances.

4) was it ventilated properly yes, it was sitting on mattress, screen side up.

5) was it within the recommend sustainable temperatures - it was at normal levels last I used it, phone exploded when I was sleeping so if temperature exceeded when it was idle it must be due to some underlying reason

 Any idea of next brand?  - I was stupid enough to believe OnePlus is going to deal with this in a proper manner and purchased OnePlus 11 after 8Pro exploded.

I'm pretty picky and there's a lot of little features I want to get it to do, but will have to play around with it for a bit.

I have mine a couple of months now and am very unhappy. My phone provider tricked me into upgrading. The usb port doesn't connect properly anymore.  The camera tends to block quite often so I missed some nice moments. I also have the feeling that the camera is a downgrade from the 0neplus 8. The whole system blocks and crashes about once per day at least. The screen bevel is a design flaw in my opinion. The phone doesn't want to unlock half of the time because it's in 'pocket mode'. The touch screen acts out from time to time. The battery lasts about half the time of the OnePlus 8. And I can keep going. OnePlus finally lost me and I've been with them since the OnePlus 1."

So I used the MSM Download Toolkit to flash back to OS11, and I am going to use 11 until T-Mo releases 13.   
Here is a link on how to flash your T-Mobile OP9 Pro back to Android 11 if you feel 12 doesn't meet your needs. The MSM Download zip is here along with detailed instructions on how to use it :

If you have any other OP device that is bricked or you want to flash back to older firmware, you can find the MSM download for every other OP device here : 

[https://onepluscommunityserver.com/list/Unbrick\_Tools/](https://onepluscommunityserver.com/list/Unbrick_Tools/)

When using an app in a minimised state like maps or a video on Google Chrome for example. You no longer grab the corner of the minimised screen to make it bigger, you pinch and stretch like zooming in on a photo. Minimised app where very buggy particularly with the maps app during earlier versions 

When holding an app on the home screen there is no longer an option to delete the app only to remove it from the home screen

The gallery app has been changed to the photos app which works differently.

Some customization features are different but that doesn't really bother me too much, I haven't even changed my wallpaper."

I have the Pixel 6 Pro which uses the same manufacturing process and it is probably the worst phone I've used in 5 years. The 8+ gen 1 actually seems really solid with a better manufacturing process so I'm tempted to go for the 10T.  But I'll ultimately probably wait for the S23. The 10T is hardware wise the superior phone as compared to the pro. And Android 12 in general has been a dumpster fire on every device not just OnePlus.

Maybe 12 works flawlessly on your phone, or maybe you weren't unhappy with it because you think they made it better with the following updates, but for people who came following 10, 11, etc, the 12 feels like a massive downgrade, even in basic functionality.

Here’s one test that shows just how much better the 13 PM is. @4:48 If the tester didn’t just record video for the remaining time the differences would be even greater..49% vs 12% remaining on the 9 Pro at the time of starting the video test. 

All I’m saying is that I actually owned the 9 Pro for a year and I now own the 13 PM..and I can safely say that for **my usage** battery life has literally doubled, so fast charging isn’t really that amazing since I can easily make it 1-2 days (and well within reach of a charger within that kind of timeframe). Not to mention the 13PM can charge at speeds of up to 27W..so it’s not really that slow tbh.

Either way, Download accubattery and cpu spy and see if your phone goes to deep sleep properly and check what app uses the battery.

Something is messing up, and it always comes down to a bad app and or bad optimization of that app specifically for the phone model in question

So a lot of this is dependent on the price, at regular retail price, the OP 9 (Pro) costs the same or more than competing phones but is objectively worse in a lot of areas (support, camera, updates, etc.) which leads to the question of why bother with a OnePlus phone when you can get a phone by Samsung, Google, Apple, etc. and be assure of having a similar (or identical) level of performance, much faster and in some cases longer supported updates, much, much better customer support and more third-party accessories when you're paying nearly the same amount of money. 

The question becomes a lot murkier if you can find it on sale and can't find the competing phones on sale 

A $1K OP 9 Pro vs a $1.2K Samsung S21 Ultra is a hard sell for the OP 9 Pro given that the Samsung phone absolutely dominates in terms of timely software updates, customer support and camera quality while performance is nearly identical between the two. But if you can find the OP 9 Pro on sale, suddenly that gap isn't so big, are those compromises worth $200 on a $1K phone? Probably not. But those compromises become a whole lot more attractive the lower the price (assuming the competition doesn't drop their price) 

None of the OnePlus phones have been -bad- phones, but recent ones have certainly been -overpriced- phones, especially compared to the competition."

4351,Is the OnePlus 9 THAT bad ?,Careful_Version1498,10747,12/3/2021 5:00,It's a nice phone for the price...but u know people won't be satisfied with anything.
4352,Is the OnePlus 9 THAT bad ?,Maethor_derien,10747,12/3/2021 5:36,"I think more of the problem is the value for the price doesn't add up.  While it is a great phone it doesn't justify the price they are asking.  It is likely worth it if your not in the US but for example right now I can go to my current provider and get the S21 ultra for 400 dollars if I am willing to trade in my oneplus 7 pro and a similar deal for an iphone.  I literally can get a better phone for less money even accounting for the difference in what I could sell my phone for.       The great rebates you get from places like AT&T make it hard to go with something other than Apple or Samsung.  

Even at normal prices though your still within 10-20% of the other flagship prices and you have much worse support, updates take way longer to get and you don't get them nearly as long and you get them half as often, repair/rma is an absolute shitshow, a worse camera and other little features that are missing like samsung/apple pay,  are some of the big disadvantages.   The accessories are in general much worse and harder to find anything decent. Because the charging is proprietary instead of using the standard used by almost every other phone you also can't just easily borrow or a cord or brick to charge at a decent rate.  You can't use any of the battery bricks to quick charge either for the same reasons like you can with a Samsung or apple phone.   It isn't anything that by itself would be game breaking but it is a whole bunch of little things that feel subpar or end up being an annoyance to work around.  

The phone in my opinion is about 60-75% of the quality of a Samsung/apple phone(it goes down as the phone ages since they are really bad about getting OS updates to the older phones as a decent speed) which was great when it cost half as much.   The problem is that now the price is 90% of the competition but only offers at best 75% of the value."

The only negative I have is that I noticed the dropped frame rates at times. I only wish there was an option to set the frame rate minimum of 90hz at all times.

4364,Is the OnePlus 9 THAT bad ?,,10747,12/3/2021 5:15,It sounds like the solution to your problem would be to roll back the update rather than spend all that money in a whole new device. If you wanted to buy a new phone a pixel a series would be a better choice. OnePlus phones aren't really special when they come at the same hefty price tag and bloat as the competition.
4365,Is the OnePlus 9 THAT bad ?,DodderyCobra,10747,12/3/2021 6:04,"I'm sure you've made up your mind by now, but I'll throw my two cents in here just in case you read this.

Short answer: It's a solid all around phone.

Long answer: It's not perfect, but every phone on the market isn't perfect.

I used a OnePlus 6 prior to getting the 9. I told myself the OP6 was the final OnePlus phone I'm buying. When my OnePlus 6's screen started to have issues, I checked the market, and the best bang for your buck was the OnePlus 9.

I got mine for $629 back in August, and I can't complain at that price point. Snapdragon 888, 120hz OLED, 48MP main camera, alert slider (fucking hell I love this feature), and 65 watt charging (15 watt wireless too, but I don't use wireless charging). 

There's really nothing else that can match that. No it's not the best camera ever, but that's really all you're losing out on. 

It was either this, or the Galaxy S21 (non plus, non ultra). I decided on the OP9 and I have no regrets at all."

I've only had an issue with the case I got off Amazon - it was advertised as being for the Oneplus 9, but the cutout for the alert slider was slightly too low, and the power button doesn't align with the phone. But I can hardly blame the phone for those issues. My new case is on the way!"

My Friend has OnePlus 6 and he was thinking to upgrade as OnePlus 6 series has reached end of life (aka no more software updates)

So I took his device, got rid of buggy OxygenOS 11 and installed Pixel Experience 11 ROM. I was surprised.. The device literally turned into pixel. The experience is so much better... It was so good that I was tempted to sell my current OnePlus flagship and  use OP6 instead...

And since its actively support it gets monthly security updates and it will also get Android 12 similar to Pixel 6 shortly...

And I have not rooted it for him... So its like a stock OS so all bank apps work as well.


So If you are going to Sell or Trade your current OP6 anyway..why don't you give this a shot... Maybe you will end up keeping it.."

Still, cheaper than competitors, so if you are not looking for zoom camera, you can live with it, since it has pretty Good balance overall.  
But I regret buying it since I paid too much for it in May, but I mean the depression is just coming from too much of Hype I'd say, it is good phone if you are looking for budget flagship with descent camera, but Vivo X60Pro+ or X60T Pro+ is also close price and has one of the best camera out there. so I got X60Pro+ as well. because Hasselblad affected color, which is just personal preference, (Don't get me wrong, Oneplus has very natural color)

4425,Is the OnePlus 9 THAT bad ?,Alocasia_Sanderiana,10747,12/3/2021 5:15,"This answer is the correct one. The OP9 and 9 Pro have a MSRP that is far too high in relation to other comparable phones. This is why at MSRP, other phones are a better value (this in particular is highlighted with the price of the Pixel 6 & Pixel 6 Pro).

So unless you buy when the OP9 and 9 Pro is on sale it's really not a good deal. Honestly I would say the only way it's a good deal is if it's on sale, nothing else is on sale, and you need a phone ASAP. Otherwise just wait."
4426,Is the OnePlus 9 THAT bad ?,BDLifts,10747,12/3/2021 14:47,"How is the Premium 8k video on a 9 Pro compared to that Samsung?  30 frames a second smooth!  That's how it is.

Samsung?  Only 24 frames a second.

So much for Samsung being higher spec.

If you down convert 8K video to 4K it's like pixel binning for better focus and color.... 

@ 30FPS on 9 Pro it converts 1:1 and stays smooth.

@ 24FPS  on Samsung you can't get those missing 6FPS back, so you lose ability to capture smooth, natural motion.

That's not the only place where the One Plus is better.

Every brand and model phone is a trade off...

The best thing to do is get your hands on one and try it out to see if it works for you."

4428,Is the OnePlus 9 THAT bad ?,BDLifts,10747,12/3/2021 14:57,"Screen Protector. (You're getting older)

Using a 3rd party wireless charger will make it get hot.  Best to stick with OP chargers made to work with it.

I use a 2 meter long cable in the car, with a 60 watt UDB C PD charger.  Depending on level of charge it puts out as much as 35 watts, which means it will still charge reasonably fast, even if you are using wifi, bluetooth, tethering, gps, cell data, and full screen brightness.

After my OP 7 Pro port lasted 2 years solid plugging in to charge everywhere and still held the cables fine, I am not worried about wearing out the charging port.

Maybe you might try a different charging pad in your car?

Does anyone have a good charging combo for mobile wireless charging a 9 ot 9 Pro?"

It's way easier on the eyes anyway.

Not everywhere will 3 days be possible.  It requires being near a good cell tower.

I get that @ a friend's house in Salem  Oregon.

I get 1.25 days max @ my home though.

I can agree eith others: the 7 Pro definitely was easier on the battery.

It's really no big deal.

It's called ""branding"" and it has nothing to do with performance, battery life, or cell reception.

That said, the phone is incredibly easy to root and install a 3rd party ROM in, so it's only an issue if you are afraid of following instructions to chage it...

I am waiting for the ROM: Pixel Experience to be available for the 9 Pro, but with the stock One Plus camera app.

4477,Is the OnePlus 9 THAT bad ?,RickyFromVegas,10747,1/28/2022 23:47,"Major downside is the camera and the sustained throttling performance. 

1. Op9 does not have the optical image stabilization, so taking pictures of things in less than ideal condition is a bit disappointing. Not bad, just disappointing as things can look blurry or soft. It needs to crank shutter speed up to compensate, but it just leaves some distaste when you're used to having OIS. 

2. Snapdragon 888 on op9 is nice, but if you're playing games, it heats up too much and throttles within minutes in sustained performance. Once throttled, it performs much like the predecessor SD865 but at much higher temperatures and higher energy consumption (don't quote me on the last part)

3 this isn't so much a downgrade but something to think about. It has plastic sides instead of metal. This in itself isn't so bad, but does feel a bit less ""premium"" to some, I guess it would be up to you to decide.

And for you, guess the price is very similar, so I can't really make recommendations for you, but in the US, used markets make 8t a pretty much no-brainer at selling for about $300 US"

Top-notch design, IP68-rated, especially nice Alpine Blue.

Superb OLED, 12-bit color depth, color accurate, 144Hz, Dolby Vision.

Very good battery life, incredibly fast charging.

Good Dolby Atmos speakers

Flagship-grade performance and stability
.
Outstanding photo and video quality from all rear cameras, day and night..

IR blaster, 4 promised major Android updates, 5 year of security patches.

Cons.. 

The selfie camera is disappointing

I posted about this on another forum and also found [this video on YouTube of the exact same issue. ](https://youtu.be/PpOoB3gCca4?si=IbktEECODQBr6q0l).

Yesterday was the first day those pre-orders started receiving their Xiaomi 13T and 13T Pro phones. This morning I was recording 4k video in an air-conditioned room and in my car (~25 degree Celsius) and after 3-5 minutes of continuous 4k 30fps video recording on the main camera, the fog built up on the inner side of outermost lens/glass piece. The video is obviously blurry, mostly noticable in the form of while glow when shot on white object against dark background. Today I went to Xiaomi local service center and found the other who got exactly the same problem (her and my are 13T Pro model). Xiaomi issued a replacement bill for us to contact vendors for replacement. At the vendor shops I also found the other guy who facing the same issue as well. So I think it might be a defect on the whole lot of manufacturing. Really upset about this. Has been a Mi fan since 3-4 years ago and been using their 10T for 3 years now without any trouble.

13T pro does not have wireless charging if you care about that, but to compensate it charges ridiculously fast.

Software is also quite different, 
pixel = minimal, clean
Xiaomi = very modified, kinda bloated but bloatware can be removed. 

Since the 13T pro is brand new there's not really many reviews out yet. 

I also considered the galaxy s23, here it's €45 more expensive but they give you a free tablet or Chromebook with the purchase. But the s23 is a tad smaller, which I don't really like.

Oh and the pixel 8 pro comes out in a week or two, if they have improved battery life, it will probably be the best option in our price range. So might want to wait for that."

I have no idea how some youtubers reviewed the cameras (I assume outdoor shots only) but I took a photo from indoors aiming outdoors (IE relatively difficult lighting) and the 13t pro looked horrendous. 

The only Xiaomi that looked as/almost as good was the 13 ultra. But I still prefer the P7P. My P7P fingerprint scanner is busted due to water damage hence looking for alternatives. It's looking likely I might buy another P7P since the 8 series is way overpriced IMO.

TLDR - P7P if camera is important to you."

Unfortunately, I have to make a decision and pick one of these specific options.  
The Xiaomi 13T Pro I can get now for a major discount as the price in my country will probably be around $800-$900 and I can get it now for $600.

Same deal with the Pixel 7 Pro. The price for it here is $1000\~ and I can get it for $500.

I also read the Pixel 7 Pro has some overheating issues and the battery is subpar but on one of the reviews I read I saw that the battery score for the Pixel is higher than the Xiaomi so I'm really not sure if the Xiaomi 13T Pro's battery is even worse than the Pixel.

It’s Huawei’s unique strengths as an organization that make it possible for them to pull the entire domestic supply chain up behind them. Eventually all Chinese consumer tech brands will benefit from that. But Huawei fundamentally is the one making it possible.

4664,"HUAWEI Mate 60 Pro, Kirin 9000S Soc",PeteWenzel,12530,9/1/2023 21:37,"Yes. I know and I agree. Huawei is the only serious competitor to Apple and even just Samsung. That’s why the US is doing everything they can to kill the company.

Over time patriotism, returning 5G capabilities and Apple’s laggard role in foldables (when will they introduce their first? In 2025?) will all shift market share from Apple to Huawei in China. 

But Huawei faces huge (imo insurmountable) hurdles towards reclaiming their former market-leading position globally. First there is their lack of google services, and just as important: ultimately the US will just ban Huawei sales everywhere they can (Japan, Korea, Australia, Canada, Europe, etc.) just as they did with their networking equipment already.

So Huawei will survive. And their struggle will have greatly benefited Chinese industry and supply chains. But the company itself will never be a global competitor to Samsung and Apple again. They will forever remain fundamentally without competition."
4665,"HUAWEI Mate 60 Pro, Kirin 9000S Soc",bjran8888,12530,9/1/2023 23:21,"Huawei's future overseas markets are in Asia, Africa, and Latin America

The BRICS + SCO markets are already larger than the G7, and in those countries, not only are Google services less important (which is why the rest of the Chinese internet needs to go global), they also fear the West restricting them like they are restricting Chinese chips. (Interestingly, it's in those day that Biden banned Middle Eastern countries from importing AI chips).

Ultimately, most countries will choose to maintain a relative balance between China and the US, and then there is a huge space for Huawei in this - Huawei will eat up the space for iphones in Asia, Africa, and Latin America (potentially Huawei will be 50% 50% with Apple). Personally, I hope that Chinese internet companies will enter developing countries in a big way to replace Google's services after the relationship between China and the US is relatively stable.

The West as a whole accounts for about 50 per cent of the world's GDP, but the other 50 per cent is what Huawei and China are working towards."

> In February 2003, Cisco Systems sued Huawei Technologies for allegedly infringing on its patents and illegally copying source code used in its routers and switches.[7] According to a statement by Cisco, by July 2004 Huawei removed the contested code, manuals and command-line interfaces and the case was subsequently settled out of court.

> Huawei's chief representative in the U.S. subsequently claimed that Huawei had been vindicated in the case, breaking a confidentiality clause of Huawei's settlement with Cisco. In response, **Cisco revealed parts of the independent expert's report produced for the case which proved that Huawei had stolen Cisco code and directly copied it into their products**.

To say nothing of how many Chinese nationals work for Western tech firms...

Edit: Reddit isn't letting me reply below, so I'll do so here. /u/Put_It_All_On_Blck

> That's because ASML just wants to sell EUV machines, they don't care about anything other than EUV machine profit. But it's an extremely poor short term view to take

It's the exact opposite. As long as Chinese fabs can access ASML tech, they will continue to depend on it, and the funding/incentive for domestic solutions will be sparse. But if they're banned from using it, then suddenly domestic alternatives become incomparably higher priority, and unlike most countries, China probably has the resources to do it. 

Western tech companies have been very clear about this risk, as they stand to be the biggest losers not just from being directly restricted in the Chinese market, but also then being forced to compete with Chinese companies in the rest of the world. These Western companies also all have experience with China's talent pool, and have to deal with both losing that, and then competing with it. 

> And it's not just the U.S. that didn't want EUV machines in China. Taiwan and South Korea also were heavily against it for obvious reasons and the EU recognized the issue too, hence the ban.

That is not true. All of those subsequent bans followed direct pressure, if not force, from the US. Same for previous sanctions."

Yes, and? If you wish to become a world super power while starting at scratch, you simply can not waste time and resources reinventing the wheel. There are moral horizons you have to cross, if you are ever to reach that goal. There's no shame in it. How did you think the US jumped from an agricultural state to an industrial superpower in the 19th century? It wasn't by [respecting Europe's IP](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/the-spies-who-launched-americas-industrial-revolution), let me tell you that much. As a matter of fact, the current sanctions will probably result in *more* IP theft, as China now has to steal some patents they could've otherwise gotten via diplomacy. 

>So you're saying that any sanctions on China are solely because of the US?

perhaps not the *sole* reason, but definitely the primary reason. Remember, these nations are fully capable of sanctioning China on their own. If those other reasons were enough, that's what they would've done. they would not have needed the US to ""convince"" (read: threaten) them into it. Also, see below for examples.

> that article doesn't say that ASML are against sanctioning thieves, they just warn that it may lead to supply chain issues.

perhaps that article was too indirect. How about [this one](https://asiatimes.com/2023/01/sanctions-move-china-to-replace-chips-supply-chain/) then; I'll just provide some direct quotes: 

> In an interview with Bloomberg News published on January 25, Peter Wennink said, “If they cannot get those machines, they will develop them themselves. That will take time, but ultimately they will get there.”  
>  
>The Netherlands and Japan have been resisting the US government’s attempts to drag them into its sanctions regime because they, like American companies, have a lot to lose. Tokyo Electron, Japan’s largest maker of semiconductor equipment, has been getting about 25% of its revenue from China recently.

pretty self explanatory, yes? 

>The Netherlands can make its own choices. And it did.

Surrreee they did. It must be a total coincidence that they made their choice after being pressured repeatedly by the US and resisting it for months. They *absolutely* made their choice out of their own free will. No doubts about it. 

&#x200B;

One last thing before I go. I actually don't have a problem with the US sanctioning china. They're just doing whatever they can to maintain their world leader position. If the situation was flipped, I have no doubts that China would do the same; heck, it's what I would do. What I do have a problem with is people treating this like it's some kind of epic tale of the good democracies teaming up against the e\~vil china. News flash: international politics aren't a fairy tale. There's no heroes or villains. These are nations acting in their own self-interest, and that's all it's ever been."

In case you forgot; It was *the US* that reached out to China with Reagan, not the other way around.

Since then the US, not ""the West"", has made China out as ""the enemy"" plenty of times, plenty of Hollywood movies and other American pop-culture propaganda are constantly framed like that.

SSMB EUV requires a very high quality electron beam with low emittance, low energy spread, and low bunch length. The beam parameters need to be carefully optimized that therefore results in making it near impossible for them to reach the throughout of ASML machines. The beam stability and feedback systems are also crucial for maintaining the coherence and power of the EUV radiation.

SSMB EUV faces a trade-off between the average power and the spectral purity of the EUV radiation. The higher the harmonic order, the higher the power, but also the lower the spectral purity. The spectral purity is important for lithography applications, as it affects the contrast and resolution of the image.  Once again, this would be near impossible for large scale high throughput manufacturing. 

SSMB EUV suffers from enormous instabilities and collective effects tha degrades the performance of the micro-bunching and the EUV radiation. These include beam loading, coherent synchrotron radiation, longitudinal space charge, transverse mode coupling, and beam break-up.

>Which firm? 

It's headed by Tsinghua university. 

>And do you think this timeline is realistic?

It depends. It's basically a modified synchrotron light source with unique undulators and laser arrangement to boost it's beam strength beyond that of a normal synchrotron. Synchrotrons are expensive, large and take a long time to build, but at the same time, they are a very mature technology that have been around for decades at this point. A dozen countries operate around 50 synchrotrons around the world, they are not that hard to build compared to ASML's tin droplet LPP method. 

The real bottleneck will be the special sauce undulator and laser that they are using, and how complex it will be to make and control them to achieve the desired wavelength and beam strength. The rest of the synchrotron will finish as fast as how much funding the project has. 

Of course, that's just the light source, there's also the maglev wafer system, the masks, photoresist, ion implantation, etching etc etc, all the other bells and whistles that go into making a EUV machine and a high end node, all of that has to be integrated into a singular system at a foundry. Of course, the light source is the hardest part so if that's solved, they're 70% of the way there."

Hence the need for a hybrid solution that combined both traits.

>The semiconductor equipment industry is currently pursuing both electric discharge produced plasma (DPP) and laser produced plasma (LPP) sources [2,3]... The EUV source requirements represent both a challenge and an opportunity for future free electron laser research.  The use of mini-undulators has been proposed using ~half GeV energy accelerators with few mm period wigglers. [7]  High energy accelerators are however larger then would be desired for a clean room or sub-facility environment.  At lower energies optical wigglers [8], Cerenkov radiation [9], and resonant transition radiation 
[10,11,12] has been recognized as a potential source technologies, however, these methods have so far not lased or 21-demonstrated the efficiencies necessary for high power operation.  Recent developments in high gain harmonic generation (HGHG) FELs have opened up potential methods to address some of these difficulties

>In Europe, the development of synchrotron radiation-based EUV sources [8] was partly supported by the European Union within the framework of the EUCLIDES program [9]. Similar investigations were performed in Japan [10] and the USA [11]. The studies showed that conventional storage rings with and without additional magnets (normal conducting or superconductive wigglers or undulators) do not fulfil all the above-mentioned specifications for the EUV source.

Today, there's still plenty of research and challenges of using FEL as a EUV light source. One major development is for a FEL-ERL system, which surprise surprise is kinda like a synchrotron/FEL hybrid too with that allows high repetition-rate and high power, but is different from the SSMB method that China is using. FEL-ERL is also quite a new technology that's still under development today and not ready for use yet, especially not when ASML was developing it's EUV in the 2000s.

It's just a modified synchrotron. Synchrotrons are a extremely mature technology operated and built by a dozen countries around the world. Even Iran can build one. Africa is constructing one right now. China has been operating a synchrotron since the 1990s. 

> there is a reason ASML avoided this method of lithography.

I'm sure that the ability of a LPP machine's to be easily exported compared to a >100 meter long building sized particle accelerator may have played a decision, not to mention that their current EUV machine played to their history of making DUV machines, as compared to the company suddenly building particle accelerators. I'm sure that a company whose existing factories were fitted for products were in the size range of a truck and having a compact light source that fit within said truck sized machine would naturally lean towards another compact light source and not suddenly want to build a 300 meter particle accelerator just for the light source alone.

Not to mention that ASML has been working towards EUV since the early 2000s and a lot of advancements in accelerator light sources have been made since then, the SSMB method wasn't invented until 2010, FEL-ERL is also a recent innovation. Sunk costs and all that. They can't pivot and chase after a different newer method if they already sunk in billions and years on R&D on LPP. 

China has different needs and therefore they are naturally going to build different technologies, they have no need to export a EUV for now, they have domestic fabs capable of using them.

An industry never gets some massive paradigm shift that changes the game basically overnight? Spacex tiny's little team didn't beat ULA/Boeing/NASA/CNSA/roscosmos who all collectively decided that reusable rockets were decades away? Apple basically completely changed all of society overnight with their iphone, something that current phone/telecoms leader at that time Nokia didn't invent nor predict and they couldn't keep up with the flood of new smartphone companies. Tesla/BYD didn't sweep away the legacy ICE automakers? 

CRISPR being discovered basically rendered decades old gene editing techniques and method obsolete overnight? The change was quite jarring, basically every company/research institutions switched to CRISPR within a year. 

There's currently a dozen private/government fusion programs that's all working towards energy positive fusion with just as many vastly different fusion methods, and there's no consensus as to which is the best method. The national ignition facility being the first to achieve energy positive fusion sure as hell surprised many fusion scientist. 

With a possibility space this big, how the hell can you be sure that ASML's LPP EUV method is the best one? China has different needs anyway, they have no need to export a EUV for now, they have domestic fabs capable of using them.

And for the technology of the time. It's like a battery company spending a decade and billions on creating the perfect lead acid battery with double the energy density, only for the development of lithium-ion to basically render it useless before it even comes out of the gate. Or someone spending decades breeding the ultimate superhorse that shits out half as much as a normal horse to completely change the transportion industry, only to be wiped out by the Model T. 

ASML has been working on LPP EUV since the 2000s, that's a lot of time for competing technology to catch up. FEL/synchrotron have been around for a while but have seen lots of advancements and developments over the last decade, from better control methods, to better magnets, different variants and more. Much of this improvements are just in some journal article somewhere, just waiting for someone to fund them, since FEL/synchrotrons aren't easy or fast to build. It seems like every month there's some new breakthrough regarding FEL/synchrotrons, something you don't see in the field of LPP, which is pretty static

>manufacturer who needs to make a profit in a competitive, capitalistic environmnent.

Certain fields need lots of capital, time and initial investment to make a profit. Renewables/electric vehicles were sucking up government subsidies for decades before they became profitable to stand on their own. Nuclear plants require so much upfront cost and require so much time to build that even though they make a hefty profit in the end, they almost always get build this days due to massive government support. 

You think China won't try to export their high end chips once they get access to them? When that happens, a low price point is going to be important. More or less every leading chinese industry this days were supported with lots of government money before they went on to stand on their own. 

>I'm also pretty sure asml is continuously researching possible future (alternative) technologies.

They're locked into certain technology after a while. It's hard to ask certain companies to suddenly pivot to massive new technology just because it's related to their field. It's like asking a satellite company to try to develop it's own in house rockets to launch their products, just because it's related to space. Can a company that specialized in building yachts suddenly pivot to building LNG carriers just because they're both ships? Let's ask those massive billion dollar fossil fuel companies why they are finding it so hard to switch to renewable energy despite both of them being related to the energy industry. We already know that ASML is working on High NA EUV and much of their workforce and budget will be spent on that. 

>Nobody denies that other type of sources can also be made to work.

You're denying that this source can be better than ASML's LPP EUV method. Which I disagree with. The physics behind it is sound. Synchrotron and FELs have been used as a source of high energy Xray light for decades, with many inherent advantages, high brilliance, high collimation, low emittance and smooth continuous spectrum. FELs and synchrotrons themselves have been looked at for EUV lithography before since they both can produce EUV wavelength easily, with synchrotrons having the issue of low power-10 watts compared to LPP's 250 watts and FEL having the issue of producing short pulses of radiation instead of a near continuous beam, though they can get into very high power ranges of 10s of kilowatts.

China is using a method to boost a synchrotron's peak power to >1kw to make up for the lack of power. While America/Japan/Europe have looked into various FELs variants, like FEL-ERL and self-seeding FELs, that allows for a FEL to fire a more continuous beam of radiation. Do note, all of this methods are fairly new. Self seeding FEL only got a major breakthrough in 2012 and SSMB as a concept was only invented in 2010, in case you want to start asking why ASML didn't adopt any of this methods before.

However, what I gathered from reading research papers about this is that the challenges are significant. The operating parameters of the envisioned synchrotron EUV are difficult: a 1A current and microbunch spacing of 3nm. For context, there is no synchrotron in the world that operates at 1A; the highest I've seen is 0.5A and the SSRF operates at 0.3A. However, it's plausible that since these are research synchrotrons that have to support a broad range of experiments, it might be easier to optimize a narrower set of parameters to a higher level in an industrial synchrotron built for a singular purpose. For the microbunch spacing, you will need a optical resonator for the microbunching and there's no comparable parameter in any other synchrotron so I have no context to point to, but the precision here seems very exacting. So there's a bunch of engineering challenges to solve while building their new synchrotron.

Do note that LPP is also extremely complex and thus the EUV machine has to make up for it. For example, the tin droplet mechanism alone is a marvel of mechanical engineering. It's dropping 50k tin droplets a second and you have to hit said tin droplet multiple times with nanosecond precision to produce the laser in the precise characteristics that you want it. Compare that with a synchrotron, where it's more or less a continuous laser beam.

The optical system is as complex as it is because LPP is incoherent and isotropic, thus you must have a collection mirror to minimize losses, and since it is very hard to get full collimation, beam transport will require multiple mirrors. The optics must be grazing incidence, which strongly limits the possible mirror geometries. That means its very difficult to have 100% collection just starting out. Every additional mirror is ~30% loss, so that's why LPP is so low powered. A Synchrotron/FEL light source will have an advantage just because the beam has a high collimation from the start, and will not require as much collecting and transport mirrors, alongside other advantages like high power and high coherence. And I might be wrong on this, but having such a better light source could also mean that the mirrors don't have to be quite as precise as the Zeiss mirrors that ASML currently uses.

There's also the fact that molten/vaporised tin isn't good for the mirrors and the wafer, so there's a bunch of complicated mechanisms to isolate the wafer from the tin debris and to clean up the tin debris and stop it from coating the mirrors, and even then the mirrors have to be swapped out more often due to the tin debris. A good chunk of the parts that the EUV is made of and the engineering complexity is probably all to deal with the tin droplets and their debris. Something that accelerator light source won't have to deal with.

The issue for China that might be as hard as the light source is also be the other components that go into a EUV machine. The photoresist, the mirrors, the masks, the picometer precise laser interferometer, the picometer precision mag-lev wafer control system, the ultra-high vacuum chamber etc etc, since they all have to be domestically produced and not imported. But let me tell you that China is also busying pouring in billions into this areas to hopefully built them up in time for the EUV light source and there already been quite a lot of progress already. 

And of course, even if this SSMB EUV light source is a complete unprecedented success, the fact that you're gonna to need to build a brand new high end foundry alongside a brand new synchrotron means that even if the technology was perfected today, it's probably going to be 10 years before enough new foundries are built to produce enough high end chips for China's needs. That and high end foundries are extremely expensive, that's probably a few hundred billion in costs there just for the fact that you need a brand new foundry instead of just integrating a few EUV machines into an existing foundry for less than a billion.

But said EUV will be a next generation EUV with more than double the power ASML's EUV, which should allow for much more complex semiconductor to be fabbed. So lots of pros and cons to this approach that China is taking."

Do note, this is also for the foundry's sake. For a ASML's EUV, you can fit it within a existing foundry without too much issue, for a >100 meter accelerator, you more or less have to completely re-design the foundry around the accelerator and probably have to build the accelerator first and build the rest of the foundry around it. And we all know how insanely expensive and difficult new foundries are to build.

- H20pro was announced as such a great piece of technology, blah, blah, Leica, blah, blah... It produces shit photos at best, entirely within the range of what was available 3-4 years go, and photoenhancing ""AI"" isn't worth a dime, especially in low-light environment.
- H20mate/lite's camera is even worse (obviously), photos are shaken, blurry, grainy and if you look at it on a computer screen, it's full of blocks resembling 8-bit graphics and not in a good sense. I get it - it's not the most expensive smartphone ever, but it's also not cheapest one either and still doesn't manage to deliver acceptable effects.

I am 100% sure H30 is going to be shit too, because improving the technology  from H20 to ""acceptable quality"" in such a short time would require ""give Elon Musk all resources in the world and ffs don't disturb the man!"" kind of miracle."

I don't really have anything to hide... if they wanna stalk me, sure, have fun. I feel like people that are very opposed to Huawei must be hiding something. Maybe it's child porn or maybe American intel, if you have something like this on your phone I can understand your concern. I mean, what the fuck could they do with information about your private life? I don't think they'll make a fool of you online or bust you for telling a friend you stole a snickers. Besides, I believe the US does the exact same thing but that's cool with everyone. I live in Sweden so the chinese or the americans, doesn't really matter who gets the info from my phone. 

This comment is not just meant to aggravate, I am genuinely curious to hear arguments and for someone to convince me that Huawei is bad or dangerous."

Very long focal lengths basically remove any of the depth information you would get from perspective.

Well that just means a Huawei user has to be wary of the US AND the CCP instead of just the US. It isn't any beneficial to throw whataboutisms when we're trying to strive for privacy rights.

&#x200B;

Correct me if I'm wrong but, I'd argue that a Huawei phone would be much much worse than any other regular ol western smartphones not just for its software but for its hardware as well. Huawei makes their own SOCs (The CPU and other computing bits bundled up for a smartphone) under the Kirin trademark instead of buying Qualcomm's Snapdragon SOCs. Whilst Qualcomm openly release their kernel sources for each of their SOC, this is the opposite for Kirin (and MediaTek, another Chinese chip company).  


In layman terms, Qualcomm is more open about its chips whilst Kirin (Under Huawei) and Mediatek, isn't. Which raises suspicion that they might be hiding something else within their chips. It doesn't help the fact that tech companies in China have to have 100% unrestricted ties with the CCP or else they're not allowed to operate at all.   


And by the way, Huawei has now disabled developers and Android modders to unlock their phone bootloaders. Think of it like not being able to modify your car's engines because the car company doesn't want you meddling and removing parts of the car.   


They specifically do this to lock users into their own modified Android ecosystem which includes forced ads, other stupid spyware crap and will prevent you from uninstalling unwanted system apps. Compare that to plain ol Google Pixels (non contract ones) where the kernel sources are available, and the bootloader's easy to unlock so you can modify it however you want from rooting your phone to completely replacing the entire Operating System. Hell you can ever Overclock it with a tweaked Kernel."

I guess it would be neat for a concert or something as a one off IF it was clear. Since it’s not clear what’s the point? It’s probably just very high megapixel then digital zoom slightly beyond that. I’m sure Apple and Samsung phones could let you zoom this far if they didn’t care about it getting all fuzzy.

Huawei's 5G technology was a national security issue as they were first to market by \~6 months and would have caused vendor lock in at the expense of western companies. 

&#x200B;

If Qualcomm writes and releases an Android kernel it is only as a value add to their OEM partners. HiSilicon is Huawei's CPU subsidiary and produces CPU's primarily for Huawei's products. Just like Apple's Intrinsity group (an acquisition for their world leading CPU design talent) , it makes no sense for HiSilicon to give away trade secrets to make XDA happy.

&#x200B;

Huawei is a Chinese company.  I would expect most of their technical literature to be in Chinese. There are paid services that offer remote unlocking of Huawei devices so it is pretty safe to assume that the info is out there in Chinese but no one will translate it for free.

&#x200B;

Yes, Google may provide open source technical documents on the Pixel's kernel in English, but the very important Google Play Services is a closed source trade secret. You know, that suite of vital software that you need to turn Linux into the usable phone OS known as Android.

> Germany's IT watchdog has expressed scepticism about calls for a boycott of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, saying it has seen no evidence the firm could use its equipment to spy for Beijing, news weekly Spiegel reported Friday.

> ""For such serious decisions like a ban, you need proof,"" the head of Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), Arne Schönbohm, told Spiegel, adding that his agency had no such evidence.
 
> Huawei has faced increasing scrutiny over its alleged links to Chinese intelligence services, prompting countries like the United States, Australia and Japan to block it from building their next-generation, super-fast 5G internet networks.
   
> The US has put pressure on Germany to follow suit, Spiegel wrote.
   
> Schönbohm said BSI experts had examined Huawei products and components from around the world.
   
> They had also visited Huawei's newly opened lab in Bonn, where German clients can inspect the firm's cyber security measures and the software behind its products.
   
> But some observers raised eyebrows at the BSI's apparent dismissal of cyber security risks concerning Huawei.
   
> ""I believe it's wrong to suggest that the concerns about Chinese espionage are unfounded and easy to detect,"" telecom security expert Ronja Kniep told AFP.
   
> ""Even if Huawei has no official relationship with the Chinese government, that doesn't mean Chinese services aren't using the company and its technology as vehicles for espionage.""

Please don't make such statements without citing some sources - and by sources, I mean well referenced and reputable ones. Ones that explain the tech behind the alleged spyware/backdoors.

I'm not for or against China (but definitely do recognise their proven misdeeds/criminality), but in the 12+ months of reading these bold claims, I've yet to find anything other than 'suspicions' and allegations, with no cold hard evidence behind the claims.

The world Governments are actively pulling apart Huawei devices and hardware, and as far as I'm aware, no categorical proof of China's exploits has ever been shown. The closest I've seen is a recent report on just how incompetent the developers at Huawei are, leaving room for potential exploits and vulnerabilities. 

But if you think that's intentional or speaks to some conspiracy, then you must think the same for every other single hardware and software manufacturer - any piece of hardware or software is *riddled* with potential vulnerabilities and exploits, it is the nature of complex systems.

So it’s a 10x.native with a 5x digital stacked on it.

Some phones like the Pixel have such an emphasis on computational photography and machine learning that they don't need multiple cameras to peice together an image at qualities superior to individual digital camera lenses. They instead rely on our unstable hands to re-orient the camera on the image, and the photo outcome is a result of piecing together the information gleaned from dozens of low res images taken at slightly different angles. This allows some cameras with only digital zoom to maintain a higher sembalce of resolution that they normally ought to.

I'll admit I too find the fact that you can't remove Google apps frustrating. However Android phones can be sold without Google Apps, Android works fine without it. I'm not sure why Huawei decided to make it an irremovable system app.

But it is refreshing to note that you can have full on customization on phones that allow you to unlock the bootloader to root your phone so you can remove basically anything, or completely reinstall a custom firmware that replaces the entire OS (Like Lineage OS).

But Huawei doesn't allow that sadly. The ability to unlock the bootloader is solely down to the mercy of your phone's manufacturer and Telco provider (unless you bought it off contract)"

6489,The 50x zoom on the Huawei P30 Pro,Novocaine0,9635,4/22/2019 11:07,"So in the first link from NPR a journalist says 

>This indictment reads like a screenplay. It describes in detail how *Huawei tried to steal the technology powering a T-Mobile robot named Tappy so that it could build its own robot in China.*

A journalist says Huawei tried to steal a technology, okay. **If they actually tried that, this is something important.**

Second link from Irish Times says 

>US accuses China's Huawei of stealing technology

Which is not really something of a proof since it's literally an allegation 

>Huawei said it was “disappointed to learn of the charges brought against the company today”, adding that it had sought discussions with the US justice department after Ms Meng’s arrest but “the request was rejected without explanation”.

Justice department refusing to discuss with the company doesn't sound so good.

Third link says 

>As the race to dominate the world's next-generation 5G networks  intensifies, **the Trump administration is seeking to stop Huawei equipment making its way into the communications infrastructure – and to give its American competitors a leg-up.** 


So the US government is trying to help American competitors of Huawei with these charges. That's also worth noting.

And then goes on 

>So Huawei dispatched an engineer from China, identified as FW, to Seattle. **He allegedly accessed a T-Mobile laboratory, took measurements and photographs of Tappy, and sent them back to China. Another Huawei engineer, AX, later tried to steal one of Tappy’s robotic arms but was caught, the indictment says. He claimed he “found it in his bag”.** 

**Same story of the NPR and again, if this is true it is important.** Seems like the only story of ""stealing technology"" mentioned in these links so far.Same story in the arstechnica articles.


Last two links are about Samsung's allegations so I don't think they're really relevant to ""Huawei stealing from the west"" since only story about this theft appears to be the case of Huawei *trying to* steal a robot technology from T-Mobile.

This makes them pretty much unacceptable for me and I prefer other chinese brands like Xiaomi.

edit: So that also means even if there is no spyware on the phone at the moment they can just push it at any time and you couldn't even tell. If the bootloader would be unlockable, you could prevent this easily. I just want full control over my own hardware that I paid money for."

So it’s a 10x.native with a 5x digital stacked on it.

You're thinking about this all in terms of conventional optics, full frame sensors and zoom lenses. This phone has none of the above. All of that smoothness you see is digital zoom and software. The phone has three sensors each with its own prime lens. The primary one which handles 1x-10x has a 'natural' focal length, probably 24mm in full frame, and zooming from 1x-10x just crops down on this sensor (it is very high megapixel). At 10x it switches seamlessly to the periscope telephoto lens with a different sensor, then continues to crop up to 50x zoom. The third sensor has an ultrawide lens that handles below 1x."

That's pretty much it. You'll have everything: Tencent owns 40% of Epic, which, according to the superbrains on this site, means that they are in complete control of a foreign business (while conveniently forgetting Spotify and hundreds of other examples).

And it's cyclical too. Don't think we've heard all that garbage years ago? How about PUBG? 

The truth is that this is a hoax at most and typing any kind of sensitive term won't do shit for your game, especially not if it is not being published in China and even then, it's probably a restriction served to a chat-enabled launcher on top.

In case that is not enough: I've tried this for many games with friends in China - nothing ever happened. If there is a game that just flushes chat through for anyone to browse, it's likely not one any of us are playing. Simple hoax, and now naive people keep spamming it on fucking reddit, who'd have thought."

No problem. And it is a very messy issue. I included the links about Samsung even though they are not the 'west' in order to show that Huawei is alleged to steal from basically anyone.

however, you can get a lens that adjusts from (for example), 70mm to 300mm - THAT is a zoom lens. 
you can also get lenses that go from mega-wide angle, almost fisheye, to very wide angle, such as from 10mm to 18mm - this is also a zoom lens since it can adjust focal length between two points, despite those two lengths being very wide angle.

Huawei had used the access it gained by being a handset supplier to obtain copies of the robot's specifications and steal software, parts, and trade secrets from the lab.

6872,The 50x zoom on the Huawei P30 Pro,,9635,4/22/2019 14:34,"Jpeg compression is lossy inherently. 

If, for an easy-numbers example, the camera sensor takes a picture that’s 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, and the phone screen attached to it is 5,000 x 5,000, you could zoom into any 5,000 x 5,000 quarter of the image and still see 100% of the resolution available. In that sense you’re not even zooming in really, just basically doing pan & scan. It would be more accurate to say that, when viewing the full zoomed-out image, that *that* is artificially shrank down and digitally smoothed or sharpened. “Zooming in” to any given quarter of the image would be viewing each camera sensor pixel to each display pixel 1:1 (bar any post processing or other trickery that’s going to happen anyway).

the education is better (in mathematics/science). College is affordable for most city people. if you are below poverty line, you can have a loan at a really good rate. the pension they pay to retired workers are way above the poverty line so people can retire at 60-65 and live out their lives. There are medicare/Medicaid if you have terminal/long term illness, and a form of basic healthcare that pays a certain amount per month for minor illness like a cold. mandatory maternity leave and there is absolutely no way a company can fire you for it

you can criticize the government. depending on what you say, it might stay up. attacks on Xi will get deleted, but it's mostly likely it'll get deleted after it gets 10 likes or so. nobody is gonna arrest you because that means they'll have to arrest 10% of the population.

it's not a free country by any means, but they are politically really restrictive but taking after a European model when it comes to social welfare. The control is tight but most reports in the West are nonsense. Its the same as how every time a mass shootings happens it swept over all media, as if it's super common, but in reality it's still a rare thing. It doesn't excuse those though.

6987,The 50x zoom on the Huawei P30 Pro,kermityfrog,9635,4/22/2019 12:26,Then it's a 5x telephoto. Zoom means a lens that can change focal length.

I'm going to have to disagree. Many people download their pics, crop and fine tune color balance and view them on larger screens."
6989,The 50x zoom on the Huawei P30 Pro,,9635,4/22/2019 14:49,"It still makes no sense. Lossless zoom refers to using the full sensor output. 2x digital zoom already uses only a quarter of the pixels on the sensor. That has nothing to do with the resolution of the display and never will. If i take a picture with my camera at 16mp and then go on my computer and crop out an area with 1920x1080 it will look worse than using an adaquate focallength to capture the same area with the full sensor and then shrinking the picture down to 1920x1080.

Also as impressive as the results of the P30 Pro are for a phone the 5x optical zoom isnt lossless either because the 125mm telelens module only uses a 8mp sensor compared to the 40mp of the mainmodule with 28mm. Having 8mp with 125mm focallength in a phone is pretty dope, though. But it isnt lossless."
6990,The 50x zoom on the Huawei P30 Pro,Calciphylaxis,9635,4/22/2019 12:03,"By that logic the regular lens provides un-zoom compared to the telephoto lens.

The point is that zoom is a feature of a particular lens. Not a comparison between different lenses. 

If appears as zoom to you because your phone is switching between lenses. 

It’s fine to think of it as zoom, but it’s also cool to understand the real definition and how things actually work."
6991,The 50x zoom on the Huawei P30 Pro,OobleCaboodle,9635,4/22/2019 11:57,"No, you're misunderstanding what zoom means. It's the ability to adjust smoothly between any focal length.

It's easy to say a government has no shame when you are not one of its constituents. In fact the pain and sorrow goes deep, and the memories live on. A lot of redditors seem to think Chinese people don't know about those things. We do. We were taught cultural revolution as part of our history in middle school and high school, we were told stories about 6.4 from our parents. And even today the supression of information is still discussed and well-known. Chances are, if you have internet in China, you know censorship. And you know it's not right. That's why we get defensive when we talk about these things.

South China sea- Before it all began The US  sent it's own navy ships into China's millitarized territory (please see the so called ""freedom of navigation"") this was confirmed by India and Malyasia.

Using North Korea has a Nuclear shield- lol as if the US hasn't once used diplomacy like that.
Seriously though how childish are you to actually think that's something ONLY China does?

Forced biometrics collection- Making a point like this when US basically invented Mass surveillance

One child Policy- Quoting Wikipedia again

>However, a recent demographic study (showed) that China's low fertility was achieved two or three decades earlier than would be expected given its level of development, and that more than 500 million births were prevented between 1970 and 2015, some 400 million of which may have been due to one-child restrictions.

The West is weak, complacent, disorganised, corrupt and has no unity. It is an empire that’s sinking. Whereas China influence and power grows everyday. The control they have on there pop grows everyday. There economic capabilities will soon surpass us vastly, there tech has arguably surpassed us in many areas. The CCP has demonstrated nothing but an aggressive foreign and domestic policy. After all it’s in their interested. It seeming like they reach large scale automation and AI before we do. 

So how long really does the west have until we’re all Chinese’s puppet states. Buying CCP phones to give them free intelligence on us is not going to help us."

Yes china doesn't allow evil cults to flourish and is fighting a war vs violent Islamic extremists with education unlike USA who just executes people with bombs.

You support Taliban and Isis, roadside bombs and hundreds of people dying regular to violent attacks? Because that is the result of ""freedom"" across the border in Afghanistan compared to Xinjiang where china takes a humane and effective approach to their own Islamic terror problems.

>After a careful study of the reports on Da Ji Yuan [Epoch times], I found the two witnesses are not reliable and most probably they had fabricated the story.

Some, like my country Australia, allow one man, an American named Rupert Murdoch to own 80% of all our papers and play kingmaker and meddle in every election. Others like china don't think it's good idea to allow private companies with no loyalty to country to do endless anti china propaganda.

Some countries allow religious brainwashing by Taliban and Isis, like across the border in Afghanistan, to happen which results in road side bombs, suicide bombs, women being discriminated against and forced to wear ninja masks etc, china doesn't.

USA allows such ""freedoms"" or ""liberties"" but after terrorist attack happens, they just straight execute anyone they claim is suspected terrorist or bad guy. China doesn't. Instead they ban extremist brainwashing and educate them to be moderates and build their infrastructure and give them a future.

Funny how you ignored the meat of my argument and just focused on semantics.

And this number is almost always have a link to its document in the government database. Think this is as a Chinese government version of whois service. Try to visit https://z.cn (Amazon China) and you will see this number at the bottom of the desktop version page, right of the coat of arms of Chinese police. Amazon china’s beian number is 11010502030232. 

This link and that small coat of arms will definitely trigger an dns query, thus it should not be a big thing.

I’m not saying Huawei is totally clean just saying for this case, it should be a false alarm."

If you visit a website in China, you can notice there will always be a link/registration number at the very bottom of the page. 

In the case of Baidu, it’s:
京ICP证030173号 (Beijing Internet Content Provider No. 030173)
京公网安备11000002000001号 (Beijing Public Internet Security Registration No. 11000002000001)

And there is a logo before the last registration number, which is linked to beian.gov.cn
I think this is the source of the DNS request.

The person just updated the github explaining that he was incorrectly filtering requests and the dns requests were being made while testing baidu.com  

**THE PHONE IS SENDING CHINESE DNS REQUESTS WHILE MANUALLY ACCESSING A CHINESE WEBSITE**  

Being a government domain doesn't mean anything, just some resource on baidu was requested from that address.

The other 2 (hicloud and dbankcdn) are owned by Huawei and even if you open the apps just to say that you don't want to share data, they'll likely send a request to check the servers are up."

Still am, but I acknowledge this is very much real. The only reason why I think the U.S. is spreading propaganda is because they're hypocrites.

At the end of the day, *someone* is spying on us. Be it the CIA, the Chinese, or the Russians, someone is tracking our data. Hell, they're all probably doing it simultaneously. The Chinese government just happens to really fucking suck at hiding it. 

It's not even governments spying either, advertisers do it too. I grabbed pizza a couple weeks ago from this place just off campus. Paid cash, place had no wifi, location tracking was turned off. Half an hour later I get an email from Google asking me to leave an online review for the place I ate at. There's also a video on YouTube where this guy confirmed our phones are actively listening to us, when he got bombarded with ads for dog food after saying it repeatedly within earshot of his phone.

I really don't care what info they get either. My Honor 7 is on a prepaid plan, I don't make purchases over my phone, so my bank accounts are safe. There's basically nothing on here to weaponize against me, and I really don't care who is spying on me.

Is it wrong? Yes. Is my right to privacy being violated? Sure is. is there anything I can do about it? Nope."

Im always skeptical of the US government claiming a foreign company that is threatening US business interests is doing bad shit. I assume they all are doing bad shit, but spying on foreign civilians seemed a bit out there. There was no proof presented and everyone hopped on the ""fuck Huawei"" train because they didn't get a pixel 3 for free after their 6P died after 4 years. 
 
This changes the game, atleast for me. It's tangible proof that shows data being sent to the Chinese government. However, is this the Chinese ROM or the global ROM? AFAIK, it's been a proven fact that the Chinese ROMs send data to the government. It hasn't been proven on global ROMs though.

again some accusation without context, providing which app under what setting was trying to contact the server

hysteria here about Huawei it's hilarious

next time when your phone will be comparing IMEI against local gov database if stolen phones from police don't forget to report how your phone send data to gov and there are tons of other legitimate scenarios

I work on Huawei projects and am more familiar with their services than most of these big hackers with their discoveries and bold statements

edit: so as I said it's false positive and it's just Baidu API verifying page registration most likely to check malicious sites, nothing to do with Huawei even

The guy has since admitted that he MANUALLY opened those websites, which is why they showed up in the logs, and has even deleted the thread.

There has been no proof whatsoever of Huawei ever using their network infrastructure equipment (let alone their smartphones) to spy on people, let alone feed information to the Chinese government.

But thanks to people like you, smear campaigns like the one being driven by the US right now actually have a decent chance of success, as it seems people are more interested in typing witty comments to justify their point rather than actually fact-checking what they're fed, or at least reading the full articles instead of stopping at the headline.

If you had actually taken that approach towards the whole Huawei topic, you would realise there's absolutely zero reason to think they've ever done anything like that. Suspiciously, it's just the US and five-eyes countries throwing these vague articles around, all of them with shocking headlines but zero actual content (to avoid being sued of course), hoping for people like you to take the bait and cascade their shit even further down your social circle.

I don't give a shit about Huawei but it just bothers me so much that we now work like this as a society. Somebody gets accused of, say, sexual abuse, and even if there's zero evidence (maybe the original accusation was even made up), the internet pulls out their collective pitchforks, starts calling the guy rapist, pushes an endless campaign against the guy and how this kind of people ""shouldn't be allowed"" near our schools/neighborhood/whatever, and by the time he's declared innocent it doesn't even matter anymore... he's a rapist in the mind of 90% of the people and he will never get a job again.

See?! This is why I'm so damn skeptical of ""Huawei is spying on their foreign customers."" someone says some shit, turns out to be wrong. So many people got these hair triggers for having proof of Huawei spying. 
 
Guess I'm still going to maintain my opinion that Huawei spies on its own citizens but wouldn't risk spying on their international consumers because of 3 things:
 
 the rewards are way too low. Maybe for personal vendettas, yeah but a collection of user information for well over 100M foreigners? Not much one could do with that. Their market shares are too small in the outside-of-China market to be able to do anything with it. 
 
The blowback would be way too costly. Huawei just took the #2 spot in the phone wars. They are trying to rapidly expand their presence in western markets. US and US allied companies are cracking down on Huawei and already gaslighting the American public. If it came out that they were collecting data from their customers, that would halt all of that market expansion. They would face hellacious fines, and probably be banned from the US market. It would be an absolute disaster for them as a company. Even if the PRC is supporting and benefiting from Huawei (even though the US government has done the exact same thing with Google and US telecommunication companies) why would they risk expanding their economic influence just to get American and European dick pics? 
 
There are other ways. Cheetah mobile is a Chinese company that has been proven to have been collecting data from multiple apps that users download. They have as many ties with the PRC as Huawei would. Huawei doesn't have to spying on their customers when people are voluntarily downloading their apps that collect data. 
 
 and there are much easier ways of collecting data."

I do not fully understand what is the problem. If you don't want to resolve the domain name of baidu.com or beian.gov.cn, do not access web sites contain these names.

EDIT: so if we go down the actual record https://github.com/pe3zx/huawei-block-list/blob/master/analysis.md what it says:

* The device is accessing a web page on www.beian.gov.cn on 4/11 at 11:15:13. If this is some part of a baidu.com test as the writer said, it is likely the guy just clicked on the link then the device had to resolve the name.
* three seconds later a link to GMW.CN, a newspaper, is clicked. The device again tried to resolve the name to IP
* Two minutes later. The guy clicked on China.com.cn, another portal, the device is trying to resolve the name

Again if you do not want to access Chinese website, do not.

EDIT2: he cleared it up this is all just a joke

> **But after carefully analyze a series of packets, I can conclude that the DNS requests to beian.gov.cn was made by some domain names on behalf of baidu.com which I manually entered to evaluate the rules.**

He was evaluating some undisclosed baidu websites. The website contain a link to beian.gov.cn. Now he is suggesting everyone's device is sending data to beian.gov.cn??? In what world this is logical?

To the writer: let us know exactly what you are doing. Why you are accessing the undisclosed baidu website. So we can access the same website and see what is going on.

What does beian.gov.cn do? go to the website, it seems it is the agency that keeps record of website's ISP (internet service provider license). Baidu.com, China.com.cn, and GMW.cn, all keep a link to beian.gov.cn on their homepage as requested by law. Coincidence?

I have not met a single guy who works with DNS professionally in any form which shares this view. Quite the opposite. 

DoH is DNS reinvented badly by the DNS-illiterate Web 2.0 crowd, which *knowing the DNS-people are against this, still went ahead and put it in production*.

Technically, Apple can go back and weaken security, by eliminating your passkey from encryption chain. But, this will require an iOS update and for user to enter their password one more time to decrypt the filesystem. And I do believe Apple requires phone to be unlocked to do an update. Or previously unlocked and passcode entered, in order for update to be scheduled.

The law doesn't say you have to use a specific DNS server, I call bullshit on Mozilla being liable.

The ISP still allows connections to the sites, they're the ones not following the ban because it was simpler to add some rules to their DNS (and also avoided annoying customers).

>Why put yourself in that position when what we have actually works, and works well?

What we have, for most users, has shit privacy and security.

>Don't bike-shed some random shit in the browser and call it a day. That's called half-assing it.

That's the opposite of bike shedding. They worked quickly on a solution that works and is better than DNS for most users (the ones that don't run their own server).

The discussion is basically on whether it should be a default or not. In principle I think it should default to the OS but because most users won't go to the settings I understand why they'd make DoH the default, the people that care will change it in 10 seconds.

There are those emulators like Gspace or Gbox, but those are PIA, and even with those you don't have Google Services. So eg  cloud based functionalities like GPhotos or GDrive won't work, similar to Banking Apps and Google Pay, including NFC payments."

I think they focused on their access point business. Once the sanction hit they were not able to produce a 5g modem that could fit in a phone. At least not yet."

Poco 5 one year newer

X 5 Better Camera

Pro Version get normally longer updates, security!

F5 pro my choice

 If U need 108 pxl camera x5 pro or f 5 pro

With x5 pro U can all Games, longer updates for everday use is budget soloution

The whole chipset Snapdragon is better. In future there are more custom Roms on Pro

Amoled and Gorilla Glass are much better

Pls tell US witch U choose."

7865,"Which is a better phone in your opinion, the xiaomi poco f4 gt or xiaomi poco f5 ?",chengxiaoblue,12258,9/6/2023 16:54,"Well, the word ""overheating"" isnt always the phone become hot. Usually the manufacture set the temp limit so that if certain temperature reached, they will throttle themself so other component such as battery isnt suffer from the heat and degrade faster. F4 gt might not so hot, but it does throttle quiet fast (especially if u live in tropical country or others that have higher room temp). Other smartphone that suffer from sd8 gen1 is xiaomi 12 & 12 pro. 

In this case poco f5 also quiet suffer from throttling (longer use may drop it to around 70% of its performance) , but i think becos they dont want it to outshine their higher end they set the temp limit a bit lower so they throttle a bit faster than it should (or the build is suck and cant dissipate heat faster, idk)"

First, wait for Ark Mobile 2024 revamp, currently slated for April, which should have better support for devices

Second, this is more risky, and something I've only heard about and never tried, but you can try finding android apk online, it may not work but those are the only things I can think of other than a new phone"
